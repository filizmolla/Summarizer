 Hello, how are you? Looking at the eyes of the man otel No Every time the sun goes down I let you take control I can feel the paradise before my world implodes And tonight had something wonderful My bad habits lead to late nights and in a low Confessations with a stranger I barely know Swearing this will be the last but it probably won't I got nothing left to lose or use I'll do my bad habits lead to late nights and in a space And I know I lose control of the things that I say Yeah, I was looking for a way out now I can't escape Nothing happens after two It's true, it's true my bad habits lead to you Oh My bad habits lead to you My bad habits lead to you Every pure intention and when the good times start Falling over everything to reach the first time spark Oh Started on a new light And then it all got dark And you only know how to go too far My bad habits lead to late nights and in a low Conversations with a stranger I barely know Swearing this will be the last but it probably won't I got nothing left to lose or use I'll do my bad habits lead to late nights and in a space And I know I lose control of the things that I say Yeah, I was looking for a way out now I can't escape But then it happens after two It's true, it's true my bad habits lead to you My bad habits lead to you Oh We took a long way round But till the fun run out Now I'm the bad habits lead to late nights and in a low Conversations with a stranger I barely know Swearing this will be the last but it probably won't I got nothing left to lose or use or do my bad habits lead to I hate I stare in space and I know I lose control of the things that I say Yeah, I was looking for a way out now I can't escape But then it happens after two It's true, it's true my bad habits lead to you My bad habits lead to you My bad habits lead to you
