 As a hacker, you have to stay hidden. So when you're hacking a machine, you get to hide your tracks. Cover your trail. So in this video, I'm showing you two ways we can hide our files on our target machines. One way is on Windows. We actually hide a file inside another file. The second way we're using Cali Linux, and we're going to hide a file inside a photo, a process called Stagnography. You need to learn, learn, learn hacking. And everything I picked up in this video are skills I learned from ITPro TV, the sponsor of this video, and this hacking series I'm doing. So if you want to dive deeper into anything I'm talking about here, hiding your files, going under the radar, covering your trail, they go a lot deeper than I do, and you get a chance to get hands on and labs that are pre-built and amazing. So check it out link below or keep on code network chuck. You'll get 30% off forever. It's awesome. Trust me. Now like always, disclaimer, warning. Do not use what I'm teaching you here to hack someone without permission. This is for ethical hacking. That means you're going to be hacking people with their permission. If you're cool with that, keep watching. The first thing we're going to do is take a file in Windows and actually hide it inside another file. We're using a technology called ADS, or alternate data streams. And this is crazy. I had no idea this was a thing. It's actually a feature or a file attribute of the NTFS file system. What Windows uses. And we're legit hiding a file inside another file. Let's do it. So go ahead and fire up that command prompt. We're going to be using the CLI for most everything right now, which if you're an average Windows user might feel strange, but it's fun. I promise. Come on. Let's go. So right now in my command prompt, I'm in the documents folder. To make things a little bit easier on us, I'll make a new folder here. So I'll do MKDIR, or make directory, the same as Linux, and I'll name this my hidden stuff, which you probably shouldn't do if you're trying to hide stuff. Anyways, it's an example. And then I will CD into it. CD, change directory, my hidden stuff. And I'm there. If I type in DIR, I'll see you. It's inside. And right now there's nothing. Now the first thing I want to do is type up my super secret message. I want no one to see. So we'll type in notepad, the select should launch the notepad application. So I lied. I'll be using a little bit of GUI here. And we'll create our file super secret file.txt. It'll prompt me to create a new file. Yes, I do want to create a new one. And I'll put in a secret message. Alright, I'm all done. I'll hit control s to save and close that bad boy. Now we'll create our fake file, our front file, the one that we want people to see. I'll type in notepad. And this will be nothing to see here.txt. Same situation. Type in my nothing to see here message. Control s to save that. Close notepad. Now time to hide our file. And it's super simple. Watch this. I'll type in type. Type, just like that. I'll first specify my super secret file.txt. I'll put a space, my right angle bracket, space once more. And I'll specify my nothing to see here.txt file. Now here's the important part. We'll type in colon and then put in super secret file.txt. This one command using ADS, our alternate data stream, will hide our super secret file inside the nothing to see here file. I'll hit enter and we're done. Well, almost. See if I do a DIR, my super secret file is still there. We can't have that. Let's delete it. So I'll type in DEL for delete and super secret file.txt. It's gone. DIR once more. Not there anymore. But where to go? It's still here. Trust me. You want to see it? Okay, let's do it. I'm going to type in CLS to clear my screen, make sure things are a bit more clean here. But I want to show you once more. I type in DIR. The file is not there. Just nothing to see here. Nothing, nothing going on here. And if I type in notepad, nothing to see here.txt, which will open that file. Again, nothing to see here. And if you're just looking at the file explorer, it's not there. But let's try this. Same command. Notepad, nothing to see here.txt. But if I do colon, super secret file.txt. There it is. It's hidden inside that file in an alternate data stream. Really cool, right? Your average user, even your average admin, may not even think to look for this. Now that begs the question. As an admin, how would you find out if someone's hiding files inside other files? Let's see. We can enter the command DIR. Same thing we used to look at our files. But instead of just DIR, we'll type in DIR forward slash R. And look at that. We can see the alternate data stream with that command. We still have our nothing to see here file, but then we also have there's something to see here. And the alternate data stream. So keep in mind, this is a super cool way to hide stuff. But like everything in IT, it's not foolproof. There are a variety of tools and just a simple command to discover that information. But your average user is not going to find that. Now we hid our secret message file inside another file, which is crazy. But we can also hide that one file, which is a common thing that you probably already know how to do. But we'll do it via command line right now. So once again, if I do a DIR, nothing to see here, it's still there. But if we do a Trib plus H and specify that file name, nothing to see here.txt. Well, now if we do DIR, they're really ain't nothing to see here. And looking back at my finder window, there isn't anything here. Of course, pretty easy to bypass. If we go to view, options, change folder search options, and under view, we can say show hidden files, folders, and drives apply. As an admin, I always have that option checked. So this would have never been hidden from me, but for most people, I can't see it. Okay, now we're going to take it one step further. We're going to take a picture, a regular picture, a JPEG file, and we're going to hide our super secret message inside that picture and plain sight. Who would expect the file to be hidden inside a picture? This is a file hiding technique called Staginography. And this is like movie secret agent stuff. Let's do it. So for this, I'm going to fire up my Cali Linux box. It's what I use for hacking. You can use another Linux distribution, but I highly recommend this. The first thing we'll do is install a tool called Stag Hide. So I'll do pseudo, APT install Stag Hide. And I'll do dash Y. Now I already have mine installed. It's just going to go, yeah, truck, you already haven't installed, but that's what you would do. Once you have that installed, we're ready. So here, I'm going to do an LLAS to list my directory contents. I have a picture here. Let's take a look at it. Completely innocent picture. Me driving a Kubernetes boat, the thumbnail for my last video, or second to last, but we're going to hide our super secret message inside this. So I'll close that right now and I'll create my super secret file, nano super secret file.txt. My super secret message is in there. Control X, Y, enter to save. By doing LAS, there it is. Time to hide it. The command will be Stag Hide and Bed. I'll do dash CF. This is my cover file. The file that's normal. Fine. It's the picture. So I'll type in that file name. Nothing to see here.jpg. And then I'll do a dash EF. My embedded file. The file I'm trying to hide, which is super secret file.txt. And that's it. I'll hit enter and it will prompt me for a password password. And that's it. I'll just like before. If I do with LAS, my super secret file is still there. So we need to take care of that. Let's remove it. So I'll just type in Remove, super secret file. And now it's gone. I'll do an LAS and it's disappeared. It's gone. But no, it's not. It's inside that picture. Now if I open that picture, it's a normal picture. I mean, it's an awesome thumbnail. But from looking at it, there's no super secret message here. We're safe. But if we open it back up with the command Stag, Hide, Extract, and we'll use the switch dash SF and specify our picture. Nothing to see here.jpg. We'll get a password prompt. Put in the password we created. And a file was extracted. If I do LAS, there it is. If I open that file, there it is. And just like that, I hit a super secret file, a super secret message inside a picture, which is just cool. That's cool. Now I hit a file inside a photo, like legit I did. And I want you to find it. So I got a link below. It's a challenge. The first five people to find that hidden file in the photo will win a prize. The prize will be six months of access to this is IT, which will give you access to all the training I produce as well as David Bombal. If you don't know what that is, not check it out below. This is IT.io. Okay, so this video, I showed you two ways to hide files. One on Windows. We hit a file inside a file using ADS. Now I do have to say this. This is not a new technique. Obviously, it's been around for a very long time. And most of the time on modern systems, it won't work. At least for that crazy nefarious purposes. Like right now, if you go on your Windows machine, you try to hide a file inside a file with ADS. It's going to work great. But if you're actually a legit hacker, a bad actor, or you're doing a pen test, scanners, forensic investigation tools, will find these files without even blinking. But this type of technology, this type of thing is important for you to learn. Even if it doesn't work on every single system you encounter. So if you're studying for the C.E.H. Man, they want you to know that. They want you to know what ADS is and NTFS and how to hide files in Windows. Now the second one I showed you is Stagnography where we hid a file inside a picture. That's legit. Can be used. It is awesome. A lot of use cases for that. Anyways, let me know what you think below. This is part of the journey of me learning how to hack. Covering your trails, staying hidden is a key thing when you're trying to hack something. Ethically, of course. Anyways, guys, that's all I've got. If you like this video, hit that like button.
