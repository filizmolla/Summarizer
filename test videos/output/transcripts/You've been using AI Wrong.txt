I found a new AI tool and I am obsessed. It's completely open source and I use it every day. It's called Fabric. Daniel, tell me what fabric is. So basically the goal is to augment humans with ai, so it's all about reducing that friction to be able to use AI for your. Problems. That's Daniel Meer, the creator of Fabric Reducing Friction so you can use AI to solve your problems. That's the real purpose of technology and ai, and that's what this Project Fabric is helping us do. I legit use this every day and I think you might too. So in this video we're going to break down what Fabric is and I'll show you how to set this up so you can start using it right now and later in this video I'll show you how I use Fabric to access my local AI server. Terry, wherever I go with a sponsor of this video, twin Gate, we'll talk more about them later. Okay? You want to see something absolutely crazy? Yes, Daniel, I do get you coffee ready? Let's do this. Now before we dive too deep, I want to give you a feel for what Using Fabric is kind of like, what's the use case? What would I use this for? This you're going to love watch this. Let's say I've got a YouTube video, this two hour interview that maybe I don't have time to watch, so I'll grab the link and on my command line I'll use the tool YT dash transcript and paste the link, and this is going to grab the transcript of that YouTube video. By the way, this is a tool that's built into fabric. That alone makes this thing amazing. Then I'll pipe that over into Fabric two hour YouTube video. Here we go. Within moments I'm told about David Bumble and everything we discuss in this video, the ideas, insights, quotes, like this one man who said that smart guy. So within a few moments I took a two hour YouTube interview and extracted all the wisdom and insights I need to know. That's crazy, right? So what's happening here? What is Fabric doing? Let's break that down. First we start off with some kind of text. In this case, a YouTube transcript. It really could be anything. And then Fabric will send this text, in this case, our YouTube transcripts off to your favorite ai. It could be models from open ai, anthropic or even local models with Alama, which again, I will show you how to access a local server from anywhere using to one gate here in a bit. Now looking at the command, it's not just sending the transcript by itself. Here you go, ai. It's using this thing called Extract Wisdom. What is that? This is the secret sauce behind fabric and something you should get pretty excited about. Daniel, tell us more about it. What I've done is take any piece of AI from any platform that is interesting and usually the language that I care about is actually prompts. So what we started doing is collecting all these prompts into this concept called patterns. A set of instructions or a way to get the AI to do what we want it to do. Now, this is not a new concept. Prompt engineering is a thing, but this, it's a bit different, different in two ways that I am a big fan of. They're open source and they're crowdsourced. I'll be the first to admit. That's kind of a weird concept for a prompt, but here's why it's cool. First, these prompts or patterns, we'll just call 'em patterns from now on, have been carefully curated, created, manipulated, added to do exactly what it's designed to do to solve a problem, a very specific problem, and it's everyone including maybe you that helps create these prompts to make them better. Now, let's take a look at this one in particular. I love this one, extract wisdom. You'll really get a feel for what I'm talking about here. And this is the other cool part about this. It's open source so you can actually see this system prompt. Normally when you're interacting with GPTs, you can't see the actual prompt being sent to the AI here, we're controlling that. We're part of that and I want to show you this one part. I think this will illustrate what I'm talking about. Look at how this prompt talks to the ai. Take a step back, think step by step, think deeply. It kind of sounds like he's talking to this AI like a human, and that's exactly the case. Even Daniel said. You're basically telling it to act like a human. We don't know why it works, but just talking to these AI like they're humans elicits a better response, better results. Kind of scary Do with that what you will, but I point that out to say that these prompts have been tested time and time again added to similar to what you would see with open source code, and this is just one pattern. Look over here on the side, look at all of these that have been created and you don't have to stop there. You can create your own, which I've done that and oh my gosh, that's the secret. It's so amazing. But hold on, you might be like me and think this kind of seems just like fancy prompts. What is this thing actually doing that I can't just do with chat? GBTI want to revisit this idea Fabric is all about reducing friction to have AI help you solve problems. And one of the areas of friction I didn't even realize I had was the fact that I had to keep going out to chat GBT, open up a web interface, load up maybe a custom GBT or start having a conversation and it didn't feel like a lot of time, but that is time it gets in the way fabric, and this is one of the reasons I fell in love with it is CLI native. You do everything here in the CLI, which I get may or may not excite you, but you're not limited to that. Daniel Meer touches more on that. What I'm trying to do is make the on-ramp to using these things as easy as possible. So I want to be able to use them via voice. I want to be able to use them via command line via a gooey app. I want to be able to just access them as quickly as possible. So that's the main thrust of this project is to collect problems, collect the solutions in the form of these patterns, and then to have as many on-ramps onto them as well. Now I'll talk more about why I love that it's here in the command line, but it's more than just how you interact with it. Think about how you might use this to build programs instead of going through the pain of interfacing with AI APIs. So that's kind of hard to say actually it wasn't. Anyways, you can just use fabric. Now check this out. I want to show you something I did actually yesterday. I'm trying to build my cardiovascular health. So I started running and rowing and I tracked that with the app called Strava, which gets all sorts of amazing data. So I wrote a Python script to interact with their API to pull down all my data and it looks like this, a bunch of messy JSON, but I created a pattern called Workout summary and it takes care of the JSON for me or I can just bake fabric right inside my Python script. And that's just a simple example. This thing is crazy. Now we're about to set this up, but I want to talk about one more thing. It's called a World of Text and it's a concept that I'm really adopting now, thank you to Daniel Mesler. Go ahead and tell him Daniel, about this world of text. 20 Years ago I got into this guy named David Allen who basically said, never ever store anything in your brain. Immediately capture. What I do now is I capture a concept or a structure for an essay or something. I capture it immediately in a note and now that it's text and because I'm fairly proficient with Vim and the Terminal, my whole world is text and the ability to manipulate text and I have all my notes in text and when I record something that's actually sound, I immediately transcribe it, send it to Notion, and so it's also in text. So now I have this world of text that I could use and now I have this AI infrastructure that manipulates text using AI to get results that help us as humans. So it's about getting everything into a text format so it can be used anywhere by anything, especially ai. And notice when I run these commands like getting this YouTube transcript, it's outputting this in marked down format so it can play nice pretty much wherever it goes, especially my notes application obsidian. Now we'll touch more on the philosophy of why I think this is amazing and I'll show you a few more patterns I've been working with. But now let's get you set up. Let's get fabric on your computer right now. And by the way, if you want to see the full Daniel Meisler interview where we talk about a ton of other stuff from cybersecurity, AI scares to just bonding over coffee because we both love coffee. I'll have that full interview on Network Check Academy. Just check that out. Anyways, what do we need? Honestly, just a computer. Now, as I mentioned before, this is Command Line World and this is going to be a Linux-based or Unix-based system, but we're not leaving out anybody here. You got a Mac, it works great on Mac. In fact, Daniel Mesler, all he does is use Mac. He loves it. Linux, of course, if you use Linux is your main desktop, you'll have a good time. And then Windows, which is what I use WSL, the Windows subsystem for Linux, so it'll work everywhere. You have Linux and Linux is everywhere. What a time to be alive, right? Coffee break. For that coffee break, the setup and install is actually really, really fast. I'm going to set up a new machine here in WSL on my Windows machine. You don't have to do this unless you don't already have one. And then best practice, just go ahead and do a pseudo a PT update to update your repos and go ahead and run a pseudo a PT upgrade if you haven't already. Now on Mac, you don't have to do that, just make sure you have your system updates and you'll be golden. Now let's install Fabric, Mac, windows, Linux. We're all following along right now. First we'll just copy and paste this command cloning the Fabric project from Git Hub. If we type in ls, there's the fabric project right there. We'll go ahead and jump in there, CD fabric. And then to install everything, we'll use a tool called PIP x, but we'll have to install PIP X first. Now on Mac and Windows with WSL, we'll do a pseudo a PT install Pip x. If you're on Mac, you'll want to use a tool called Brew. Brew is an amazing utility and I think Package Manager that enables you to install a ton of things and you should have it on your Mac. So install brew first if you don't already have it. And then with the Command Brew, say Brew, install PIP x. Again, that's Mac only. I'll go ahead and install PIP X. Yep, and now we'll install Fabric with pip x. Simply type in pip. I've been sing PIP XA lot, it's making me feel weird. Anyways, pip x install dot, that should be it. Ready, set, go and done. We have all these tools installed. I do have a note from me saying that my path variables aren't correct. I'll just run this command real quick. You might have to do the same thing. Pit backs Ensure Path done, and now Fabric is almost ready to go. We'll just need to run one command fabric, dash dash setup. Oh wait, I got to refresh my terminal. If you're in Linux, you'll do source tilda or library sign, whatever you want to call that. Bash rc. If you're on Mac wll, be Z-S-H-R-C. If you're using ZSH as your default. And now we should be able to do fabric dash dash setup. And what this will do is ask you for a couple things. Your open AI, API key if you want to use G PT four and all those other models and also your Anthropic API key to use the cloud models. Now what that means is yes, you will need an API key. So if you don't already have one, go get one. I'll put a link down below showing you how to do that. I'm going to grab mine real quick and I'll paste that there. And then my Claude API key, which is the Anthropic API key. And then one more thing, it's going to want your YouTube API key. So when you are going out to YouTube to pull those transcripts from videos, you can even do comments. It will use a Google, YouTube, API key. Those are free to set up. Again, I'll have a link below to show you how to do that. And once you've added your API keys, that's it. Now you may be wondering, Chuck, why do we have to do that? Well, remember, fabric is just a framework in itself is not ai. It will use whatever favorite AI you have. Now that does mean that if you're using Open AI or anthropic, you're going to have to pay for that usage and it's a pay as you go thing. Put your credit card in there. Most of the time it does end up being cheaper than just paying for Chad GPT the Pro, but just keep that in mind. Now, if you don't want to pay anything and you don't want to give any data to anybody ever, there's local LLMs as well, which Fabric just added. Thank you, Daniel. So if you have Alama installed or llama installed on a remote server like I do on Terry, we can type in fabric and do dash dash list models. And right here are the available local models. I'll grab a YouTube video. This one by Peter McKinnon, I've been meaning to watch. I'll just grab the summary and then with Fabric, I'll do a dash dash model to specify a certain model. In my case it'll be LAMA three colon latest. Then I'll do dash SP to specify the pattern, which will be Extract Wisdom. And just like that, I'm using a local model. Now if I want to use a bigger model like Llama three seven db, that's not going to run on my local computer, but it will run on Terry. So to connect to a remote AI server, specify remote llama server, put the IP address in of your remote server. This is Terry. Specify the model Llama three 70 B, and then your pattern. Now I'm not sure what the whole Alex and Jordan thing, but that's how you do it. And when I'm away from Terry, when I'm out of the office remote somewhere, I still want to talk to him. And here's how I do it. When I'm working remote out and about as I normally do, I got to make sure I can run my fabric commands and access Terry. Wherever I am right now, it's not going to work. I'm getting nothing. That's where Twin Gate comes in. My favorite way to remotely access my stuff back at home, my office, my studio, everything. Setting up Twin Gate is pretty stinking easy, easier than standing in a field. What was that? All you have to do is set up a free twin gate account, create a network, and then deploy connector. It could be a Docker container on a Raspberry Pi in your house or running on your Sonology nas like I do at my home. And within a few minutes you get remote access to everything you want to like now lighting strikes, nah, I'm good. Wildlife maybe. What was that? But seriously, wherever I go, wherever I am, other hidden holes, I can remotely access my stuff back at home, including Terry. My AI server Twin Gate is special because they use all the latest and greatest technologies to make sure your connection is fast, including quick one of the new internet protocols that is blazingly fast. And with Twin Gate, you can control exactly what your people have access to. All my employees, I don't want you using Terry when you're away from the office, but you can log into the server and work. I'll allow that. So if you want to use my remote access solution, check it out, link below. I've been using it for over a year and it's my favorite way to remotely access everything. I even did it when I was in Japan too. Worked great. Alright, I'm getting out of here. Now let's get a bit more advanced and break down some fabric stuff first. You don't have to just give it stuff like copy and paste from a YouTube transcript or something to work with fabric. You could ask a basic question like watch this. I can echo saying, give me a list of all ice creams flavors and what year they originated. Actually, I'm pretty curious about that. I'll pipe that into fabric and we'll break this down a bit. So far we've been using the command or the switch. Sp that's a combined switch. Let's split 'em up so we can talk about it. So dash s and dash P dash s is for stream. And when we use that switch, we're telling it to go ahead and output whatever the AI says as it's saying it stream it to us. PP is for specifying the pattern. So right after you put the pattern you want to use, and we'll just say the pattern ai, which is a specific pattern, just allowing us to talk with AI just told me, no, you can't do the AI exceeds practical limits. You exceed practical limits. I'm just kidding. Let's try something more easy. There we go. Now we're talking. And by the way, when I use fabric about specifying a model, it defaults to using open AI and GPT-4 Turbo. If you want to change that, especially if you want to stick to local models, we can do fabric dash list models to see all our models and then do fabric, dash, dash change default model and then specify the model. Now we can also do the command fabric, dash dash list, just the list and it'll list all the available patterns we have right now. Again, so many things you can play with. Now I want to show you something crazy. As Daniel mentioned before, the theme behind fabric is very well, fabric E, so you got fabric, then you've got patterns. If you want to run a server, which does some fun stuff, I'm not going to cover right now, it's called a mill. But you can also do what's called stitching, which allows you to stitch patterns together. So let's try this. I've got this article, this long read about that YouTuber poppy, do you remember her? She's still around. She's crazy. It's super long read. I'm just going to copy and paste everything and put this into fabric PB paste fabric. And by the way, I know you're probably wondering, Chuck, how are you doing that? What is this PB paste thing? This is built in by default into Max. So if you have a Mac, just enjoy it on WSL and Linux. It's harder to do. I'll show you how to do that here in a minute. And if I run out of time, I'll show you somewhere else. Anyways, we'll paste that in there and I'll use the prompt, summarize. So summarize the article, and then I'll pipe that result into another fabric command or stitch it. And this pattern will be right essay. Actually I'll do a dash s so we can see that streamed in and go. Now fabric, while it's doing this thing, just think about what it's doing right now. First it's going to summarize that entire article. Then it's going to kick its summary over to the right essay pattern. That's powerful. This is crazy. Writing an essay. We can also do a thing where we analyze the claims of the article. This is not stitching, I just want to see what happens. Analyze claims, I mean, this is just cool. Again, these prompts, crowdsourced, open sourced, they've been meddled with and messed with to make 'em perfect and they're not perfect. I mean they're still going to be worked on improved. You can also do one called label and rate giving it a quality score saying it's B tier, consume when time allows. This is another superpower of fabric and the idea and the mentality is bringing two AI and how you might approach your life. We'll talk more about that here in a minute. I don't want to dive too deep, but now I want to show you how you can create your own patterns because right now we're using what's built in default just there. So I'll show you how you can approach writing a pattern and then getting it into fabric so you can use it. Keeping in mind that when you write a pattern, it remains local to you. It doesn't get uploaded to the fabric repository, and none of that's happening unless you want to submit it. That's up to you. Everything's still private. But when I first started trying to write patterns, I didn't really know how to do it. So I would just go and pick one of my favorite ones, extract wisdom, and just kind of modify it, which is absolutely a great way to do it. But then I found this, there's a pattern. There's a pattern for everything. See, a pattern means solving a problem. There's a pattern called Improve Prompt that basically does everything for you. It's crazy. So check this out, we'll do it real quick. We'll echo something and say you are, we'll just try to write it on prompt real quick, but messy, dirty. And by the way, this is a real example of how I wanted to, and I talked with Daniel about this, how I wanted to digest sermons better. I go to church every Sunday. Sometimes I'm serving in the nursery taking care of babies, and I miss the sermon. Now, I rarely have time to go back and watch the sermon throughout the week. So if I could just somehow digest it like this, that'd be amazing. But I wanted to create a pattern that would look for specific things, unique to a sermon. So let's try this. Alright, so I'll pipe that out to fabric and I'll do the pattern and prove prompt. That's crazy, right? This is so cool. So this is just live off the cuff. I'm going to take this, copy it. So now I've got my instruction and I'm going to go to the place where our patterns live. Here's where they live. We'll go to cd. We'll do dot config slash fabric type in Ls. Here we can see we have a directory for patterns. That's the patterns that fabric we'll use. And then we have a directory called My Patterns, which is what I created. So go ahead and make that for yourself right now. We'll do a mic directory, M-K-D-I-R, let's call it my super Awesome Patterns. I'll jump in there. And then to create our new pattern, we'll make a new directory. Call it Sermon Sensei. It's a has how spell Sensei? Nope. We'll CD in there. And we'll make a new file called System md. Do nano system md. Jump in there and I'll paste the contents of that pattern. Control X, Y enter to safe. So to summarize what we just did, we created a directory to how our custom patterns and inside that directory, we made a new directory creating a new pattern sermon sensei, and we created a file called System md, which is the system prompt to the actual contents of the pattern. Now, the reason we created our own super awesome special directory is that often patterns will be updated because again, this is open sourced, crowdsourced patterns are always being improved. And if they're in the repo, you'll want to update your patterns. So we might do this fabric dash update and that'll update your patterns, but it will overwrite anything that doesn't belong in there. So we're keeping our custom patterns inside my super awesome patterns. That way they're never deleted, but to make sure they can be used by fabric when we run our commands, we do need to copy everything into the Patterns folder. So we'll do that real quick. We'll simply do copy or CP dash r, we'll specify our directory, our home directory symbol tilda slash config slash fabric slash your directory. So mine is super awesome, that super awesome patterns. We'll do the asterisk to make sure all the folders and stuff are copied just so into R patterns, directory config, fabric patterns, just like that. So now if we do fabric dash dash list to list our patterns, I should see sermon sensei right there. Notice I have another one called Sermon Wisdom, which I had previously created. Now let's test out Sermon sensei. I'm going to grab the sermon from my church, one of our recent ones. Do yt, grab that transcript, put the URL there, and then pipe that into fabric using my sermon sensei pattern I just created. Now this is pretty cool and honestly I think it needs some work. So just like the open source patterns in the fabric repo, you can work on yours and keep iterating. So the one I really enjoy is the one I created Sermon Wisdom that I think does a better job and that really does demonstrate the power of a really, really good prompt. I mean, I love how it pulls out quotes. Probably one of my favorite things, and that was killer is the references pulling out all the scripture or things that he mentioned in the sermon. I love that. Now looking back at Fabric, if we type in fabric help, we can see there are options we haven't mentioned yet. We're not going to go over all of them, but one thing I do want to touch on is the idea of a context. I'll let Daniel talk about that real quick. This is the latest thing that I've been working on under Config Fabric. We now have a context file. My context file is about increasing human flourishing by helping people identify, articulate, and pursue their purpose in life. Helping people transition to Human 3.0 to be our best selves. This is literally my soul that I'm translating it to text. I haven't done this yet, but I want to make a context for myself soon. Now I've got two more features. I want to show you the PV paste option for Linux users and the ability to save anything you create with Fabric two obsidian, my favorite notes application, what I use and what I've been obsessing over for a while now. Oh, it's so cool. I just found this. But before we get there, I want to talk more about the philosophy behind Fabric and why it's kind of captured my imagination and why I feel like it's more than just a fancy prompter. Now, to understand that, I think we need to know a bit more about Daniel Mesler. Daniel Meer is a hacker. That's his background. That's what he did and still does. And the reason I created it is because I basically went independent as of the end of 22. As soon as the ai, as soon as GPT-4 launched, I was working at Robinhood at the time. I built a VM program over there. And before that I was at Apple and a bunch of other places, and I had been in AI for five, six years. But when I saw g BT four happen, I was like, okay, I'm out. I basically got out and said, I need to do this full time. So I started collecting all this different AI stuff as I'm sure everyone has seen. And what I found after a couple of months is like, okay, I've got a million different prompts. Now what do I actually do with them? What I started doing is collecting them into an infrastructure that I could use personally, and this is a little bit before Fabric, but it became the content for Fabric. And essentially what it turns into is these patterns here. And you can tell just by using these patterns that this is the result of many, many iterations. It does things so well. And if you've been using AI for a while, again, you know what it feels like to use a really good prompt and had your results be so clean and almost exactly what you were looking for or even more than what you expected. And that's so fun. Now I want to get back to the idea of human flourishing. Again, that is the goal of the Fabric Project, and honestly, when you hear that, it kind of captures your imagination, right? I love, because for me, I dunno if you're like this, but the more AI advances, the more I get just a little bit more scared of where my place in the world might be. But when I hear about projects like Fabric, where it's not about replacing humans, but about augmenting humans to help us become better, to help us think better and to help us consume more content. And that's one of the main things that Daniel uses this tool for. One of the main reasons he created this tool is that there's so much content being produced all the time from YouTube videos to podcasts to articles. Just staying relevant in your space and your niche takes a tremendous amount of time. Time. You don't have to consume things. A big part of it is I am using it to determine what I should go watch regularly. In fact, I'm actually building a product around that called, but I won't say what it's called, but I'm building a product around that. So just because I need it in my life, essentially, I'm using it as a filter to determine what I should go watch and then go watch it fully. And oftentimes I take manual notes, but I watch or listen to it in its entirety, and then I go and take notes on it and it spawns thoughts. So I'm not stepping away and disengaging, I'm still reading massive number of books, I'm still watching the videos, I'm still reading the essays. What this is helping me do is just filter out or filter up or raise attention to the particular stuff that I want to watch. So a big way he uses fabric is to filter out what is good, what deserves a long watch or what just needs to be summarized and quickly digest it. And it's so cool because the way he created fabric in a lot of these prompts is he designed these prompts, these patterns in a way that is meant to mimic the way he would approach something, the way he would watch a video and take notes the way he would listen to a podcast and take notes. It's kind of crazy. My very first thing that I made for Fabric is the ability to emulate as if I took slow notes on a piece of content by hand. And that's what this emulates. Now a little story time. The past six months, I've been on a journey of being very particular, very intentional with what I consume, how I spend my time, and writing down as many things as I can, taking good notes, processing things. And that led me to my question I asked Daniel, and that's if we start using things like fabric, AI tools to do the processing and thinking for us, do we lose that value? So the curmudgeon in me, the old man in me, don't do the AI stuff. It's going to keep you from becoming a deep thinker and learning how to really analyze things. But here's what Daniel said about this. Yeah, I think the way to use it is to use the context stuff that we're starting to build now that's already in the project and basically define what you're trying to do. You can define inside of the context, I need to learn this much about these topics, recommend to me the best courses to do that with. And then when you take a piece of content and it's overwhelming, you could put it through fabric and essentially distill it down. And importantly, it could tell you what not to distill down because there's so much advantage to going back to your earlier point, you don't want to take the weights out of the gym. So everything shouldn't be a summary. Sometimes you have to put the hard work in, but you can use it to tell you or advise you or recommend to you which things you should do slow and painful and difficult because that's where you get the most muscle growth. Don't take the weights out of the gym. So he'll use fabric to help him determine what should be slowly watched and processed. We saw that earlier with the label and rate pattern. It tells you like, oh yeah, you got to watch this right now, or you could wait on that. Again, it's not about replacing humans replacing you, it's about making you better, about taking your current capabilities and using AI to increase that at a faster rate than you could before. It's about identifying a problem that you might have and then creating a pattern to help you solve that problem. And all the patterns you're seeing there that are built into fabric are a result of like, I've got this problem. Here's a pattern that can fix it. And you can do the same thing for your life. And we talked a bit about a feedback loop to where I may have fabric, I'll create a pattern for this that I'll look over my journal entries throughout the week and then it'll tell me, maybe you didn't read enough that week and that's why you're feeling sad. Or, Hey, you're feeling fantastic because you ran four times this week. Keep doing that. It's that kind of augmentation that I'm really excited about and that's where I see myself growing the fabric. And I literally use this all the time for so many things. Me and Daniel also talked about how we both started recording conversations. Like any conversation we have with a sibling, a friend, a spouse, record it, then transcribe it with Whisper ai, which is you can use it locally, it's free, and then pipe that into fabric. I actually started doing this recently with, we have a weekly bible study. We have a core group of people where we meet and we talk about our lives and things and tell funny stories and talk about what we were learning and going through. So I recorded that and I created a pattern that would extract the things I might care about from those moments. Check this out. It's so cool. So I have the recording transcribed. I'll cat that and pipe it into fabric using my GC analyzer. That's what we call our communities gospel communities. And I won't show you everything in this because it's very personal, but I want to show you how cool this is. And honestly, this whole fabric project is making me rethink about the role of AI in my life. It's here. Like it or not, what are you going to use it for? How can you use it to help make you better? And that was the first video I made ever about ai. Chad GPT came out, I was terrified, but then after processing it a bit more, I'm like, you know what? This is going to make us better. It's about us. It's about humans flourishing. There was a funny moment about, it was just a funny story about sleepwalking and it found that, that's so cool. I just did this one. Look at the funny moments here. Yeah, we talk about weird stuff, but I want to remember that stuff. I want to be able to go back to that search, have that in my second brain. That's a video coming soon. And again, I talked with Daniel about a lot more stuff including coffee. So if you want to see that entire talk, that entire conversation, you can check the link below to Network Check Academy, which is my new project, my baby, where I'm creating it. Courses to help you become awesome in it. I would love for you to join. We have an amazing community. Go check it out. Link below. Now, the two more things I wanted to show you First, this PB paste thing. Actually, you know what, I'm not going to show you right here. I'm going to make a video about it, and by the time you watch this video, that one should already be up. So go here somewhere, it's going to be awesome. Just go and jump there. But now to the Obsidian Save thing, this is so awesome. So let's take that same discussion here from my GC analyzer. I can save that directly to obsidian. There's a command that is baked into fabric called Save just like this. And what that will do is save the contents of whatever you're doing in fabric to a note in obsidian, creating a new note. Now to make that happen, we first have to tell fabric where our obsidian lives in our operating system. So if you're new to obsidian, obsidian is all about just text-based documents. Again, world of text. All it is just a bunch of markdown files and it's somewhere on my hard drive to tell fabric where that is. I'll just edit an environment file. So I'll go nano, jump it to my config folder, fabric folder, and there should be a file NV for environment variables. You can see that's also where our API keys are stored. And here's my path to the directory. I want to store new mark dime files created by fabric. With that in place, I want to take away the S option. I don't want to stream it. I'm just going to save this to a file. So I'll pipe it out to the save command and then I'll just name it and go. And then if I jump into my obsidian, which we're going to shield most of this from you, if I go to my specific folder, there it is. Auto Magically. That's killer. Again, it's all about removing friction. This is so amazing. I love this stuff. Lemme know if you like this too. Lemme know if you want me to make more videos like this about new AI tools or just exploring how we can improve ourselves and make ourselves better with the help of ai. I don't know.
