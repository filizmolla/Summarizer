This, and this is all you need to
replace Dropbox and Google Drive.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.230
You're gonna use this to make
your own cloud. In this video,

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.470
I just might convince you to stop
using Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox,

00:00:10.475 --> 00:00:13.740
whatever it is, even if you're a business,
let's kick that sucker to the curb.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.510
I almost pull a muscle. Most of
us paid Dropbox, Google Drive,

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.240
OneDrive to host and keep
our data in the cloud,

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.810
giving them control of our data.
That feels good, doesn't it? But hey,

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.060
we do get a little bit of
convenience in return, right?

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.910
We can easily share all these files
and we have the peace of mind that it's

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.940
always gonna be there and accessible
until Google decides it shouldn't be.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.910
Or they change their prices or
they go down or they get hacked.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.240
All of these things have happened. So
the solution is to create your own,

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.690
create your own clout, host your own
stuff. Now, this is actually crazy simple.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.400
All you're gonna need
seriously is a computer.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.490
It could be a spare laptop with
a little external hard drive.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.250
It could be a virtual machine, a docker
container. It can be in the clout,

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.610
which I know sounds weird, but you're
hosting it yourself. It's different.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.670
I'll show you. And you're gonna find
that Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive,

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.670
they haven't been giving us all the
features we deserve. So right now,

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.820
I'm gonna show you two self hosting
features that are kind of gonna blow your

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.960
mind. They have way more features
than Dropbox and Google Drive Gross.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.750
Don't put that gr, that was so corny
and dumb. Don't put the last part.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.220
So get your coffee ready.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.550
We're gonna give you a cloud
experience on your own hardware,

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.610
which that just sounds cool, right?
You're building your own cloud in a way,

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.370
and you're gonna learn a ton along the
way. So if you're learning it, man,

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.460
this is for you. And if you're not,
do it anyway. Cuz this is for you too.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.110
Coffee break. And by the way,

00:01:28.115 --> 00:01:30.720
this is my default route roast.
It's my stinking favorite.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.730
It's a single origin coffee from Ethiopia,

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.440
probably my favorite origin for coffee.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.180
It has notes of berry chocolate and
caramel and yes, I can taste all of it.

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.490
You can too. And shout out to File
Cloud for sponsoring this video.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.610
So now let's talk about what do
you need? Well, first of all,

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.340
you don't need these guys.
You're done. Goodbye. Actually,

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.950
before we talk about what we
need, there were two options.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.080
I mentioned now why two?
Well, let's cover that.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.020
But first I just want you to know
they're both free, completely free.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.540
But they do target different
audiences. For example,

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.520
our first one we're talking
about is File Cloud.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.880
They are the sponsor of this video.
They do have a free community edition,

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.020
but their target audience is
large companies, enterprises,

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.630
which is something I love by the
way, because I get to use a tool,

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.760
the same tool that large companies use.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.140
I'll tell you why I love
that here in a second.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.440
But the second option is next
cloud. Next cloud is pretty cool,

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.460
but it's more home lap.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.070
You probably won't see an enterprise
company using this and that's fine.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.590
Both of these have a
ton of amazing features.

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:23.820
I'm not gonna tell you
what you wanna pick.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.130
You're gonna have to figure that out.
I'm just gonna show you what they do.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.650
Now let's talk about what you
need to deploy either of these.

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:29.700
You got a couple options.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.020
Just know it's gonna be pretty easy
With an asterisk &lt;laugh&gt;, you'll see,

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.370
but you're gonna learn a lot. Trust me,

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.120
many of you'll want host this OnPrem
or in your house, in your business,

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.340
whatever it is. And that's kinda
the main selling point, right?

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.170
Like gimme my data. No one can have it.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.930
It's not leaving my house unless I
can share it securely, but you can't.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.870
So for that, you can have a spare
laptop collecting dust in your closet.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.270
You can install it on your Windows
machine you're using right now,

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.480
or a Windows server if you're a nerd
like me. Or it can go on any Linux.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.410
Server F Cloud loves Ubuntu 2004 server
L T s. I said all that backwards.

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.110
That was weird. It can also be a Docker
container. So you have a lot of options.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.220
Oh, they even have a image
for virtual box and ES xxi,

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.250
whichever option you choose. It's
really, really simple to get installed.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.060
We'll walk through it.

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.640
Then the other option I think is more
fun and you're gonna learn a ton.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.000
And that's in the cloud. So I know it
sounds weird like we're leaving the cloud,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.860
but you're gonna put me back in
the cloud. What are you doing?

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.200
You kind of have more control
though. You do have more control.

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.720
We're gonna put the sucker
in aws, Amazon's cloud,

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.570
which means we're gonna get to learn a
few things about how to do things in the

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.810
cloud like e C two and s3. I'm gonna
walk you through the entire thing,

00:03:28.815 --> 00:03:31.960
but you're gonna end up hosting your
own drive in the cloud. Your own cloud,

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.220
in the cloud. So my advice,

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.570
if you wanna play around and have fun
and learn a ton, do pick both options.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.110
Play with it.

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.830
Now keep in mind that on-prem is gonna
be completely free as long as you have

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:42.970
stuff aws,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.030
they do charge for hosting because you're
not just using your hardware anymore,

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.730
you're using someone else's
hardware and you gotta rent. Okay?

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.380
That's what you need.
Oh, &lt;laugh&gt;, I forgot.

00:03:50.385 --> 00:03:54.020
The most important thing you need
coffee you do. That's required in it.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.510
Everything in it requires copy. We're
gonna start with File Cloud. Now,

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:59.200
as I mentioned before,

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.140
one of the main reasons I love File
Cloud is because they're enterprise,

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.080
they target large companies. But
why do I like that? Well, for me,

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.700
and I think probably for you too,

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.890
the reason I build my home lab is so I
can kind of pretend to be a company cost

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:12.910
playing as a company, right?

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.600
Because I wanna get hands on the skills
and experience with stuff companies

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.570
might use and then pay me for those
skills, right? That's the goal.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.710
My home lab is to learn.

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:24.820
So any chance I can get to host
something in my lab that's enterprise,

00:04:24.825 --> 00:04:27.160
that companies really actually
might use, I'm gonna take it.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.870
And I love that you
can install on Windows.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.780
I think it's probably one of the only
host your own cloud solutions out there

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.660
that install on Windows, which is why,
why companies love it, right? But yeah,

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.650
windows 10 and up Windows Server 2000
something I, I forget what it is.

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.180
Then you put a thing
there for what version?

00:04:40.185 --> 00:04:43.900
It was the file Clouds was known as
an EFS or an enterprise file sharing

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.490
solution. E F S.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.580
Their goal is to help you make
your own private cloud as a person,

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:49.473
as a business.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.020
They got you back an emphasis on
the enterprise because it's really,

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.000
really powerful and really, really secure.

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.300
That's why they're big in government
finance and education nowadays.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.720
Data is the name of the game.
Keeping your data safe and secure,

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.630
making sure you're not sharing it with
someone you shouldn't. I mean, goodness.

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.720
Can you think about a large company that
uses Dropbox and trying to control who

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.820
they share your data
with? That's a nightmare.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.910
I'm just worried about my two kids in
there who are using Dropbox and Google

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.630
Drive, not to mention my employees.
Goodness. Now for the community edition,

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:17.320
before we install it,

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.020
lemme tell you a few things I love it
for and why you might wanna install it

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.530
right now.

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.620
Of course you get remote access to
your files from anywhere and it's free.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.150
You also have full control of your
stuff, of your data and it's private.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.980
And then this is just incredible &lt;laugh&gt;,

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.700
I've been wanting this from Google Drive
and Dropbox forever and they just don't

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.940
do it.

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.450
They have hyper secure file sharing and
what that means cuz that that's just a

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:42.250
word, right? What that means is when you
share a file password protected limit,

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:43.930
the time it's allows it to be downloaded,

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.080
limit the amount of downloads
that can occur. Create a file.

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.590
Say you can only download it until next
week and you can only download it one

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:51.940
time. That's killer, right?

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.060
Most solutions you can download a an
application that'll sync your files back

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.740
and forth, but you can also, and
I don't think else does this,

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.880
you can mount the share or you can mount
your drive as a network share and it

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.520
acts just like, it's so cool. If you're
like, what are you talking about Chuck?

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.370
I'll show you in a second. It's amazing.
Now beyond the community edition,

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.890
there are some things that they
do enterprise that will just,

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.260
you didn't even know what's
possible. It's crazy.

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.990
And we'll talk about that just for a
moment so you can see what's out there.

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:17.330
So you can learn what companies
do to protect their data.

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:20.450
I think it's important to know that
because a big thing that File Cloud cares

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:23.270
about is data governance. Putting
retention policies on your data,

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.850
having smart D L P or
data leak prevention.

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:29.030
They even have zero trust file
sharing and antivirus scanning,

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:31.130
all kinds of stuff I'll
show you. So now the setup,

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:33.950
I'm gonna start with AWS because
honestly it's the most fun.

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:36.740
Like really it's so fun. If
you don't care about aws,

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.030
if you wanna host this on your own,

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:41.990
I will have timestamps just jump
forward to that point in time stamp.

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:43.310
That's one step I'm not gonna repeat.

00:06:43.315 --> 00:06:46.550
So you wanna watch this right now and
that's setting up a file cloud account and

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:48.110
getting your community edition license,

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:52.100
which by the way used to be a paid license
for community, used to be $10 a year.

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:54.830
Now it's free. So you got
nothing to complain about.

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:57.230
I mean I'm sure you could find something
and I'll see it in the comments,

00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:00.320
won't I? I'm talking to you buddy.
Before you finish hitting enter,

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:02.180
take a sip of coffee, take a breath,

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.520
I'll take my own advice much
better. So file cloud account,

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:08.630
let's set that sucker up right now.

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:13.310
We're gonna navigate out to ce dot
file cloud.com CE for community

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:15.440
edition here. We have a lot of
the stuff I already showed you.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:19.160
Feel free to peruse that. But we're gonna
scroll down and click on download now,

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.740
which is gonna take us to the whole,
hey, you need an account thing.

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:25.730
So let's get an account.
Bernard Hack. Wow,

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.760
personal use. I have read everything man.

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:31.730
Anyone else feel out they're lying when
they click that I didn't read anything

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.630
but I do agree blindly verification
code And we're in from here.

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:37.760
It's pretty simple. We're
gonna click on download now.

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:39.740
Download now and then click on download.

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:42.080
That's gonna give you a few
options of how you can do this.

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:45.890
Right now we're gonna laser focus
in on AWS because it's awesome.

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:49.490
Clicking that will take you to the guide,
which we're gonna depend on right now.

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:52.190
And I'll walk you through and this will
be actually pretty easy now if you've

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:56.090
never used AWS before, I am so
excited for you. It's so fun. In fact,

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:58.460
right now you can sign up
for a free tier account,

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:01.520
which means you'll get a ton
of stuff for free in aws.

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:03.230
You may even be able to
set this up for free.

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:07.310
So you wanna head out to aws.amazon.com
and get started for free.

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:09.860
I'm not gonna walk you through
it, I've got other videos on that.

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.440
But go ahead and set up an account or
get logged in if you already have one and

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:16.520
meet me back here. Now here we are
in the AWS console. It's kind of fun,

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:19.700
don't get overwhelmed, there's a lot
going on. But let's navigate through this.

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:22.910
First we're gonna go up here
to the services tab or button.

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:26.750
Click that from here we're gonna click
on the compute little menu icon right

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:29.030
there. And finally we'll click on E C two,

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:32.060
which is their service to create virtual
machines and the cloud. Click on that.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.280
Now, mental note real quick.
Up here at the top right,

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:37.430
you'll see what region you're
currently in. I'm in North Virginia,

00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:40.940
which is US East one. If you're
somewhere different, just remember that,

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:43.280
write it down, whatever. It'll
come in handy here in a bit.

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:45.290
Now from here we're gonna
click on launch instance.

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:49.040
We're gonna create an e C two virtual
machine launch instance. Let's name it.

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:50.090
And then just below the name,

00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:53.150
we have the option to search for
an Amazon machine image, an aami.

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:56.100
We're gonna search for file
cloud right there. Hit enter.

00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:59.280
Now it's not gonna show you anything
until you click on the AWS marketplace.

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:03.360
Amis right here. Once you click on
that, boom, file cloud's right there.

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:07.110
First one is what we want. Click
on select Now file cloud is free.

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:11.400
Amazon isn't all the time and it's gonna
tell you the server they recommend,

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:15.270
the size and how much it will cost
you per hour, which is a T2 medium.

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:18.240
That's how they uh, refer to the
sizing of their virtual machines.

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:21.390
The amount of virtual CPUs that
give you ram hard drive space.

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:23.610
We'll walk through that. But
anyways, let's click on continue.

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.100
Now with that selected, let's
walk through this together.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.340
Scroll down just a bit. Here
we have our instant type,

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:32.280
which they already default
selected for us to be T2 medium.

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.260
Now I'm gonna go with that,
but you don't have to. In fact,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.590
I've installed this on a smaller version,
especially if you're on the free tier.

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:40.440
You can do the T2 Micro,
which is free tier eligible.

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:41.520
You can do that just to try it out.

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.440
Just have fun so you're not
charged anything at all.

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:46.620
And if you're wondering Chuck, what's
the advantage of going t2? Medium. Uh,

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:48.120
it's faster. It can handle more.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.580
You're gonna have a better experience
going with a larger computer.

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:54.120
That's true in everything from gaming to
cloud. Next we have our key pair login.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:58.140
AWS is big on using a key pair to
login. So as opposed to a password,

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:01.890
they're gonna want you to have a key that
you'll use to unlock to get into their

00:10:01.895 --> 00:10:03.660
server. And we're gonna
create that right now.

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:05.820
We're gonna create the lock and
key. That's what a key pair is.

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:07.740
So we'll create a new key
pair. If you already have one,

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:10.860
you don't have to create a
new one. I'll name this hack.

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.800
Well everything else is fine. I'll say
create keep here. And what that will do,

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:15.930
you'll notice it downloaded the key,

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.900
which I'll want to keep and refer
to in a minute. Just keep it there.

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.990
Keep it safe. The lock will be on the
server. Now that's pretty much it.

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:24.660
If we scroll down just a little bit
just to make sure everything's good,

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:27.330
it looks all good to me. You can
add more stuff if you want to.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.160
You don't need to. I'm done.

00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:33.990
From here we're gonna click on launch
instance and we are off to the races

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.170
almost. Yep, it's launching it.
It's probably booting it right now.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.200
If you wanna see what's going on and start
to access it and see all the details,

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:42.900
go ahead and click on this link right
here, which is your instance id.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.150
Now you don't have to know everything
about what I'm talking about to feel

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:48.030
comfortable here. It's fine if
this is new for you, let it be new,

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:50.610
like walking into a new
house. Just explore, have fun,

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:51.503
just don't get crazy &lt;laugh&gt;.

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:54.570
I'm gonna click on the link now and we
can see right there in the instant state.

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:56.760
Mine is still pending. So
I'm gonna wait just a second.

00:10:56.765 --> 00:11:00.420
Take a little coffee break for that
to go to like booted ready to go.

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.220
So with your virtual machine, booted,

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:07.500
we're gonna scroll on over until we
see the public I PV four DNS name,

00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:10.560
that's your server's address.
That's how you can access it.

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:15.120
We're gonna copy that right now.
Open up a new tab and paste it.

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.130
Now don't you hit enter
yet. Calm down. &lt;laugh&gt;.

00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:21.870
Before we hit enter we're gonna do a
forward slash and type in admin and hit

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:24.720
enter. Oh yeah, looking good actually
you know what? Before we do that,

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:28.440
take all out extra stuff out just
after com. Do forward slash install.

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:29.490
I like this feature.

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:33.390
This will tell you if everything's
golden and good installation checks.

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:36.120
Do you got level those check marks,
things look good. Extended checks,

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:38.520
things look good. So anyways,
let's get back to the admin.

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:43.200
So take all that out just after com,
type in admin and let's get logged in.

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:47.160
The default login will be admin and the
password will be your instance ID for

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:50.730
this machine. So let's go back to AWS
and we scroll over just a little bit.

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:54.400
Our instance ID is right here. I'm
gonna copy everything the I dash,

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:58.330
copy that paste into the
password field and get logged in.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:02.410
We are in but hold up,
we're hit immediately with
a hey invalid license file.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.630
Do we have one yet? No we don't
have one. Let's go grab it.

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:08.380
Let's get back to our file cloud
portal that we were in earlier.

00:12:08.385 --> 00:12:10.810
And notice on step two we had
the option to get our license.

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:12.700
We definitely want that.
Let's grab it right now.

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:16.000
Click get license and it downloaded
for you. That's all you had to do.

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:18.820
So now getting back to aws,
we're gonna click choose file,

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:22.270
choose that license file, open
it, apply it and that's it.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:25.540
You've got a fully licensed file
cloud instance, pretty sick.

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:29.380
Now you're immediately hit with a barrage
of notifications on the right and I

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:31.690
don't like that. Uh, we'll
solve those here in a sec,

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:33.790
especially the invalid
url. We'll cover that.

00:12:33.795 --> 00:12:37.090
But let's go ahead and click those away.
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye,

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:39.220
goodbye. No, I'm not gonna show you
everything cuz there's too much.

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:42.250
But I will give you enough to get
started to like not be totally lost.

00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:45.700
I'll give you some breadcrumbs. Now the
first thing we want to cover is storage.

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:47.920
And that's the whole point
of this entire video, right?

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:51.730
Is we wanna store our stuff somewhere
else besides Google Drive one Drive in

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:54.190
Dropbox. I'm getting tired of
saying those company's names.

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:57.540
Let's just call them the uh, the triad.
We're calling 'em the triad from now on.

00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:58.060
Okay?

00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:02.890
Currently with this install I only have
about 40 gigabytes or so of data to

00:13:02.895 --> 00:13:04.240
store, which is not a lot.

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:08.410
And the reason for that is because that's
how big my hard drive is on the AWS e

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:12.520
C two machine I deployed. If I go
over to storage in my AWS console,

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:16.420
I can see my volume right there. Now you
might be like, okay well that's easy,

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.790
just increase the size of that
volume and we could do that.

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:21.940
But that wouldn't be the smartest thing,
at least not the most economical thing.

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:25.330
Increasing your volume size here cost
more money than it would be to do

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:27.820
something else. And that
something else is called s3.

00:13:27.825 --> 00:13:31.330
S3 is Amazon's storage service
and it's relatively cheap.

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:35.620
It's gonna cost you 0.02 cents or dollars.

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:37.540
I'm not sure how to refer
to that per gigabyte,

00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:39.190
which is about the industry standard.

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:41.020
And they're only gonna
charge you for what you use.

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.910
If you only got two gigabytes
of storage up there,

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:44.590
it's gonna cost you double of that.

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:47.050
Now comparing that to Google
or OneDrive or whatever it is,

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:49.840
you'll probably get a better deal with
Google and all these other companies.

00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:53.440
But if your goal is to have more control
over your data and just have fun with

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:55.450
Amazon, this is a pretty
good option. Also,

00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:59.080
if you're a company with large amounts
of data, like large amounts of data,

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:01.390
this will end up saving you
more money than Google will.

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:04.960
And you also have the option looking at
Amazon's price sheet of going like crazy

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:07.540
cuz they had different storage tiers.
If you didn't know about Amazon s3,

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:11.200
I was pricing you the standard tier,
which is 0.023 gigabytes per month.

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:13.870
You can go for their like
infrequent access tier,

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:17.230
just stuff you wanna store that's
much cheaper. Their glacier tier,

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:21.760
like glacier tier, which
is like crazy deep archive.

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:25.360
Let's do the math on that. If
I wanted to store 10 terabytes,

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:29.110
see how many &lt;laugh&gt;, how many zeros is
that? That seems right, doesn't it? No,

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:29.740
it doesn't seem right.

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:32.590
10 terabytes will cost you 10 bucks
a month just to archive your stuff.

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:34.390
That's pretty cool. And you
have the option of doing that.

00:14:34.395 --> 00:14:36.790
You don't have that option with
these other consumer level things.

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:38.110
So I say all that to say this.

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:41.500
We're gonna set up right now an S3 storage
bucket and we're gonna connect that

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:44.590
to File cloud, which is fully
supported. So here in aws,

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:47.590
let's set up our S3 bucket.
It's actually not too crazy,

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:49.240
but it will involve two things.

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:52.880
First we're gonna set up an
S3 as you probably guessed,

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:57.860
and then we'll set up an IAM user
for file cloud to access that

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:02.570
bucket. An IAM is Amazon's identity
Access management sounds scary, it's not.

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:06.650
Let's do it real quick. First, our bucket
for s3. We're gonna go up to services,

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:09.980
the top left here and then we'll scroll
down just a bit on the side until we see

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:12.320
storage right here. Go
ahead and click on that.

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:15.410
And for us right now we
care about s3. Click on s3.

00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:18.500
And this is actually pretty simple.
First we'll just create a bucket,

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:20.450
click on create a bucket.
The more I say that,

00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:21.950
the more I like that
they called it a bucket.

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:24.620
We'll name it something for region,
let's keep it in the same region.

00:15:24.625 --> 00:15:27.950
We created our E C two, which for me
was US East one. And then from there,

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:30.020
that's pretty much all
we need to worry about.

00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:32.690
We're not gonna open this up to
the public. Keep it all default,

00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:34.850
all protected and safe. And
finally down here at the bottom,

00:15:34.855 --> 00:15:37.250
we'll click on create.
Ah, my pen create bucket.

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:39.950
We got our bucket time for the IAM user.

00:15:39.955 --> 00:15:42.770
From here we'll click on the search bar.
We're gonna search for it real quick.

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:45.560
Just search for IAM. And there
it is right there. By the way,

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:47.960
you can use the search bar as much as
you want for all the things we've been

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:51.980
doing so far. So click on iam. Ah,
it took me outta dark mode. Okay,

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:55.040
thanks a lot aws. And here
we're gonna focus on one thing,

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:56.360
creating a new user account.

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:59.480
So on the left here we have
account management or access
management and we have

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:02.300
users click on users. And then
over here on the bottom right,

00:16:02.305 --> 00:16:06.710
we'll click on add users. I'll
name this hack, well file cloud,

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:07.825
click on next,

00:16:07.825 --> 00:16:10.910
click on next once more and we'll
click on create user at the bottom.

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:13.040
We're done. Not yet though.
&lt;laugh&gt;. We have one more thing.

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:17.360
We have to give that user
account permissions to be
able to interact and use the

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:19.880
S3 bucket. So find your user
account in our list right here.

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:21.440
There's mine right there.
I'm gonna click on that.

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:23.450
And here in the middle we
have our permission policies.

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.490
On the right we have add permissions.

00:16:25.495 --> 00:16:28.250
Go ahead and click on that and
click on create inline policy.

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:30.770
Now this will be really simple cause
all we're gonna do is copy and paste.

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.930
First we're gonna go back
to our file cloud portal.

00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:36.410
And remember previously when we clicked
on download here and we chose AWS and

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:39.320
opened up a new document
here for us to look at here,

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:42.020
they're gonna have some fun stuff for
us. If you scroll down just a bit,

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:46.040
you'll see the table of contents and
we'll want to click on the last option,

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:48.170
which is post install, expand that.

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:51.200
And then there'll be a link right
in the middle setting up file cloud,

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.420
manage S3 storage, click on that. Whew,

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:56.390
A lot of clicking and we're
almost there &lt;laugh&gt;. Um,

00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:58.160
we're actually gonna do
all three of these options,

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:01.730
but we're gonna do number two first, which
sounds very counterintuitive, I know,

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:02.720
just stick with me here.

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:05.540
Click on change credentials
or configure cred credentials.

00:17:05.570 --> 00:17:08.450
And then right here where
it says under S three key,

00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:10.820
we have the following
permissions. Click on that.

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:14.720
Here we have some delicious J S O N
starting with that opening bracket.

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:18.770
We want to copy all of it until the
closing bracket or curly brace rather copy

00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:18.980
that.

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:23.810
Go back to your AWS console where
we were configuring our policy and

00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:24.830
we're gonna click on J S O N.

00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:27.020
So right now we have the
visual edit editor selected.

00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:28.850
We're gonna click on js o n instead.

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:33.290
We're gonna control A and then control
V pasting all our delicious J S O N.

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.990
Everything looks good there. Click
on review policy at the bottom right,

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:38.390
we'll name it real quick. And
then click on create policy.

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:42.050
And now our user account, which
mine was hack, well file cloud.

00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:44.480
He has permissions to
mess with our S3 buckets.

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:47.060
So back in our file cloud
dashboard, we have one goal here.

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:51.480
It has to change from using the storage
in Amazon, which is just our hard disc,

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:55.410
our drive for the virtual machine change
from using that to using Amazon's S3

00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:56.190
file storage.

00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:59.430
Now for this we do have to get a little
under the hood and mess with command

00:17:59.435 --> 00:18:01.680
line, which is kind of fun. So
let's just do it real quick.

00:18:01.685 --> 00:18:02.460
It's not gonna be crazy.

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:04.890
But first I'll show you what
we're changing here on the left.

00:18:04.895 --> 00:18:06.240
We scroll down just a little bit,

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:09.450
we'll have settings and then
we'll click on settings.

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:10.560
Go ahead and close that tutorial.

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:14.640
And what we wanna click on right now
is the storage section in our settings

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:15.570
right here.

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:18.660
Notice here in our storage settings we
can change the location of where we store

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:19.920
our file cloud settings.

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:23.460
But I don't see anything about S3
and that's cuz we have to enable.

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:26.490
And for that we gotta go to the
command line. So let's get back to aws.

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:27.990
This won't be scary, I trust me,

00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:30.360
it won't be scary if we get
back to our e C two instance,

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:31.860
which if you get back
to your e c two service,

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:33.360
you'll be able to get there pretty quick.

00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:36.330
Let's just go and open the settings here
on the right you'll see the option for

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:39.240
actions and then connect cuz we wanna
connect to us. So click on connect.

00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:42.240
And I love this cause right here at the
very bottom they have an example of the

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:45.780
command you can use to automatically
connect to your box with the key you

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:48.570
downloaded if you just created that.
So I'm gonna copy this command,

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:51.480
I'm gonna launch my terminal here and
I'm gonna change my directory real quick

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:54.570
to the downloads folder. That's
where I have my, my key stored.

00:18:54.575 --> 00:18:57.000
I just downloaded it and that's
probably where you have yours too.

00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:59.850
So I'll do CD downloads and then
I'll simply paste that command.

00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:03.690
And all this is doing is connecting
to our server via SSH using our key.

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:06.150
And it's not gonna ask us for a password.
It's gonna be pretty sick. Ready?

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:09.060
Go accept all fingerprints. Yes sir.

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:12.270
And we're in and here we're gonna
edit one file. So with me right now,

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:16.920
type in pseudo then we're gonna use Nano
cause Nano is the best text editor in

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:18.930
Linux period. Just as.

00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:23.970
And then we're gonna edit this file that
be forward slash var slash www slash

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:28.650
html slash config slash cloud
config dot php head enter.

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:30.300
And we're gonna change one thing here.

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:34.560
I'm gonna scroll down pretty much towards
the bottom of this file until I see

00:19:34.565 --> 00:19:38.790
this. Define Tony, do cloud
storage implementation.

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:42.810
Right now it says local. We don't want
that. We want it to say Amazon s3.

00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:45.930
And that's what we're gonna do.
Gonna move my cursor on over,

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:50.970
delete local and say
Amazon S3. And that's it.

00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:55.920
We'll hit control X, Y enter to save
and that should be all we have to do.

00:19:56.850 --> 00:19:59.250
And then one more thing, we're just gonna
copy a file. That's all we have to do.

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:00.450
We're gonna type in pseudo once more.

00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:05.190
We're gonna use the CP command for
copy and we'll copy this file var ww

00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:06.840
html config,

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:11.460
Amazon S3 storage config dash sample php.

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:15.420
And we're gonna copy that file to same
location. It's just gonna paste that in.

00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:17.580
But we're gonna remove
the sample and the dash.

00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:20.790
So where it looks just like this
Amazon S3 storage config do php.

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:23.100
We're not gonna change that file,
we just need to create a copy of it.

00:20:23.105 --> 00:20:25.650
Hit enter when we got it. Now
looking back at our storage settings,

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:29.670
it looks a little bit different. We
have S3 options now let's configure it.

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:33.360
So our first two options, S3
Key and S3 C. Let's get that.

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.850
We're gonna go back to our
IAM management console.

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:40.110
Jump into our user account we created,
which for me was Hack. Well file cloud.

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:43.890
And we'll see over here in
the menu options right here
in the middle kind of is

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:47.950
security credentials. Go ahead and click
on that. If you scroll down just a bit,

00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:51.490
you'll see a section called Access
keys. We wanna create one of those.

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:53.470
So let's so click on create access key.

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:57.190
From here we're gonna click on the little
radio button for third party service.

00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:01.300
Click on I understand and click
on Next describe it five o'clock.

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:03.730
And then we'll click on
create access key. Done.

00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:06.010
So now this information right
here is what we need first.

00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:07.540
Look at the access key. I'll copy that.

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:11.980
Go over to File Cloud and paste that right
here where it says S three key paste.

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:15.130
Then we'll grab the secret access
key. It's a secret. Click on copy,

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:19.390
it's copied, we'll paste it here.
And the secret for bucket name,

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:22.930
whatever your bucket name was.
Mine was Hack, well bucket.

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:27.940
Everything else is optional. We'll click
on save S3 settings, click on. Okay,

00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:29.770
settings verified, we're good to go.

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:34.870
We are now using Amazon S3 as our storage
for File cloud, which is pretty sick.

00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:39.070
So if you did this, that's amazing
&lt;laugh&gt;, because that was, yeah,

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:40.480
you gotta be honest, it's kind of complex.

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:43.390
Right now we're using Amazon as a
cloud storage provider on the back end.

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:45.670
Bio cloud is kind of our
front end and it's amazing.

00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:48.010
So let's test it real quick.
Um, let's create a new user.

00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:51.250
Kinda our first thing to do on file
cloud. Let's go to users on the left here,

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:53.170
under users and groups.
Click on add a user,

00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:55.690
it's all pretty basic stuff for
authentication notice we have default

00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:57.460
authentication selected by default,

00:21:57.700 --> 00:21:59.590
but you could change it to
active directory or ldap.

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:02.170
You can integrate with anything pretty
much. Let's put a little user in.

00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:05.800
I'll say Chuck, Chuck a
little bit of password here,

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:10.990
email address and click on Create. Now
let's just grab our URL for file cloud.

00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:12.670
I'll open up an incognito window,

00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:16.150
I'll get logged in with my new user
and here we go. My home personal cloud,

00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:18.670
just like that. First of all, it's
already here. It's already happening.

00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:22.450
Let me add a file. I'm gonna go to my
files. I'll just drag and drop something.

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:26.410
I'll drag and drop a Dropbox. Uh,
picture &lt;laugh&gt;. Perfect, it's there.

00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:30.070
Now what I wanted to show you is let's
go to Amazon S3 real quick and let's see

00:22:30.075 --> 00:22:32.290
if we have any new objects
in our bucket. Look at that.

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:34.150
We have an object one I just uploaded.

00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:36.790
Now one more thing you may
wanna do for Amazon S3 settings.

00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:40.510
So here in file cloud and our
storage, if we scroll down just a bit,

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:43.840
we'll see a button that says
where is it? Where to go. Oh,

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:46.420
right here we have S3
Encryption and Manage.

00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:48.910
We can enable Amazon S3 encryption,

00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:53.740
which will encrypt our data at rest
and in transit between Amazon S3

00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:55.900
and File Cloud. Our file cloud server.

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:58.810
I'll leave the default option here
and I'll click on enable encryption.

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:01.270
Keeping in mind that it will encrypt
everything currently in there.

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:04.450
So it's best to do this. Like
to begin with &lt;laugh&gt;, click on.

00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:05.800
Okay and we're good.

00:23:05.805 --> 00:23:10.000
All existing files and new files
will be encrypted using a E S 2 56.

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:12.970
Okay, sorry I squeaked
a bit there at the end.

00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:14.980
I feel pretty accomplished
right now. That was pretty cool.

00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:18.670
Now at this point you do have file
clouds set up in AWS using S3 storage,

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:20.950
but there's probably a few
more things you'll want to do.

00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:24.280
Like using your own domain name,
setting up a legit SSL certificate.

00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:26.140
We're gonna cover that
here in a moment. In fact,

00:23:26.145 --> 00:23:28.870
I'll put a timestamp jump to that real
quick if you wanna just do that right

00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:32.050
now. But now I wanna get into
hosting this yourself on prem.

00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:34.690
Now once you have your file
cloud CE account setup,

00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:37.690
which I covered just earlier,
installing on-prem is pretty easy.

00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:39.040
And I'll show you a few different options.

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:41.260
So here we have the option
to download our server.

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:43.480
I'll click on download clicking
on any of these options.

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:45.590
We'll show you how to do
it. I'll you real quick.

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:47.960
How to do the docker
installation, the Linux install.

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:49.640
And for a really quick way to do this,

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:52.700
just download the O V F and
actually I think docker's faster.

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:54.530
But you can download a
virtual machine image.

00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:57.770
They can just load up in virtual box
already ready to go. And then Windows.

00:23:57.770 --> 00:24:00.110
I'm not really gonna show you that
cause that's kind of self-explanatory.

00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:02.750
All you gotta do is download an MSI
installer and just go from there.

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:05.840
It'll do it for you. So let's knock
out the easy one first. Docker,

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:09.620
click on docker. Really just a few
commands you can copy and paste yourself.

00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:12.740
So here are my Linux server or it
could be your Linux computer cloud two,

00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:16.160
wherever. Let's first make sure we have
Docker and Docker compose installed.

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:17.870
So we'll do a little pseudo a P T update,

00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:19.640
make sure our repositories are up to date.

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:23.060
And then we'll do a pseudo
A P T I install docker io,

00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:26.480
docker dash compose
dash y, just like this.

00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:29.150
Hit enter little coffee
break. It'll do its thing.

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:31.430
If you have no idea what
docker is, check it out.

00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:33.770
I got a video somewhere explaining
what it is. It's amazing.

00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:34.603
You're gonna have a great time,

00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:37.400
but you don't have to know what Docker
is to run this. It's already installed.

00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:38.960
Cool. Now we're gonna do a couple things.

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:41.930
First we're gonna use this w get command
here they have fors pulled down their

00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:44.300
Docker composed file. We'll
just paste it in there.

00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:47.690
It pulled on the file if I'll do an
ls, there's our Docker composed file.

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:50.810
And then it wants us to pull
all four file cloud images,

00:24:50.815 --> 00:24:53.630
which takes a long time, especially
for the community version,

00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:56.570
the file cloud solar image.
So we're not gonna pull that.

00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:58.010
And we also don't need file cloud preview.

00:24:58.010 --> 00:25:02.270
So all we'll do is copy the command up
until file cloud preview. We'll just do,

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:05.660
we'll stop at MongoDB, which is
their database. We'll copy that.

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:09.080
Go back to our command
prompt, clean up a little bit,

00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:12.500
type in pseudo paste that
command and let the party start.

00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:15.020
This could take a minute, so just
take a little coffee break. Also,

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:16.160
keep in mind that Docker,

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:20.270
they recommend only for training and
testing and it's not optimized for

00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:23.030
production servers. Now does that mean
you can't use it in your home lab?

00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:25.370
Not at all. You probably just
use that all the time. It's fine.

00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:28.100
But if you're run into issues,
that's probably why. Okay,

00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:32.420
it actually wasn't that long. If you
do a pseudo doctor PS it's running,

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:35.600
it's going. So let's see if it
works. Grab your IP address,

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:40.070
navigate on out to the IP
address slash admin. Actually no,

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:43.190
let's do a forward slash install
to make sure it's all healthy.

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:45.140
This will do some checks to make
sure it installed correctly.

00:25:45.145 --> 00:25:47.450
Everything's running. It
totally is. That's awesome.

00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:51.920
Now let's go to forward slash admin.
We'll log in with admin and super secure.

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:56.390
Password. Password, all
lowercase. And we are in.

00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:59.120
So now the last thing we have to
worry about is the license file,

00:25:59.150 --> 00:26:01.880
which looking at our file cloud
portal, just under what we downloaded,

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:05.570
we can say get our license, click get
license and it will download for us.

00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:09.380
Just like that. Notice that to download
there. Getting back to our server,

00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:12.320
we'll just say choose file,
pick that license file,

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:13.910
apply it and we're good to go.

00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:15.890
Now there are a lot of things
we gotta do to set this up.

00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:18.860
We'll continue that here in a moment.
If you wanna jump straight there,

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:21.320
go ahead now I'm gonna cover
the Linux install real quick.

00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:22.700
So to install directly onto Linux,

00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:26.360
we'll click on our Linux X
86 64 Ubuntu Deb package.

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:29.720
It'll take us to a place where we can
install it directly from our repository,

00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:30.643
which is fantastic.

00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:35.780
Now I do highly recommend you go with
their recommended server os and that's

00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:39.920
UB 2 20 0 4 lts. Just do that.
It'll save you a headache, trust me.

00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:41.120
So go ahead and click on that.

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:43.890
And it's simply a matter of
adding some repositories,

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:47.070
updating your repositories and installing
it like that. It's that simple.

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:47.903
So let's do it real quick.

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:50.430
We're gonna copy all these
commands right here in step one,

00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:52.740
adding all the repos and
we'll paste that here.

00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:58.050
It's gonna update our repos done and then
we're going to install the Apache and

00:26:58.055 --> 00:27:01.380
Mongo DB servers. And actually I'm
just gonna do the first two commands.

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:04.740
We'll paste those here and then I'm
gonna grab the command down here that'll

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:09.360
automatically accept the ULA. And
install hands free, paste that command,

00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:12.300
give it just a little bit
of time. Quick coffee break.

00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:17.040
Now throughout the install you may hit
things like this and I always say install

00:27:17.045 --> 00:27:21.750
the package maintainer version. It's
kind of annoying, just go through it.

00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:24.480
There's not too many but
just enough to be annoying.

00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:31.170
Then right here, I'm just gonna
say why enter one more time.

00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:35.400
I think it was last time.
No look more stop it. Okay,

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:38.100
think it's done now that should be
it. Let's just make sure it's working.

00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:42.870
We'll do an SS dash tool pin and I do
see ports open. That's a good sign.

00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:46.500
I'm gonna grab that IP address and
navigate out there to see if it's working.

00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:49.830
Type in the IP address. We'll
go to forward slash install.

00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:51.870
Make sure everything's good.
Dude, things are looking great.

00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:55.110
If you get the screen, you did a good
job and if you see how blue check marks,

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:56.430
you also did a great job.

00:27:56.850 --> 00:28:01.050
So now we can go to forward slash admin
after the IP address instead get logged

00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:04.920
in with the super secret password and
use the name of admin then password,

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:05.940
all lowercase.

00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:09.060
That's the stupidest combination
I've ever heard in my life we're in.

00:28:09.065 --> 00:28:12.120
But we need a license file. Getting
back to our file cloud portal,

00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:14.970
just click on get your license and
it will download the license for you.

00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:19.500
Just downloaded mine, I'll choose it,
apply it. We're good to go kind of.

00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:22.050
We'll ignore all those messages
on the side. And then finally,

00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:25.470
if you wanna set up your file cloud
just with the virtual machine image,

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:27.330
it's super simple. You download it, yeah,

00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:29.970
spin it up in virtual box
or E S X I or whatever.

00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:33.060
It's just pre-baked and you follow
the steps I mentioned previously.

00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:37.140
Go to the install full uh url, make sure
everything's good. Then go to admin,

00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:39.750
load your file. If you're like
I didn't, I skipped those parts,

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:41.640
we'll just go back and watch
that last part. You'll get it.

00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:45.090
Now I didn't mention that all you need
to replace the triad is a computer and an

00:28:45.095 --> 00:28:48.750
external hard drive and you'll want do
that because right now my server here

00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:52.050
doesn't have much storage's got
like 50 gigs or something like that.

00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:54.900
What I want to use is an external
hard drive. But how do we do that?

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:56.460
Let's set that up real
quick. It's not too bad.

00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:58.110
And this will be specific to Linux.

00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:02.070
Now I do recommend you start out with a
blank hard drive completely clean cuz we

00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:04.710
are gonna format it. So I'm gonna grab
this guy, plug him into my computer,

00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:05.760
my Linux server.

00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:10.710
So first I'll type in the command LS
USB for list USB and I can tell right

00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:13.980
there there's my Western Digital
right there. I know he's plugged in.

00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:17.460
Now I'm gonna type in ls, B
L K. I can see right here.

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:22.230
SDB one is how he's identified on my
Linux machine and I can tell like he's got

00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:24.810
1.8 terabytes right there. Perfect.

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:26.730
Now I'm gonna double check and
make sure he is not mounted.

00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:28.620
I'm gonna type in mount
and I'll just do a,

00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:32.790
actually let's do a mount
pipe grip for SDB one.

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:35.820
Nothing. So he is not mounted.
We're good to go there.

00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:37.920
Now we have to format our hard drive.

00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:40.020
Keeping in mind this
will erase everything.

00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:41.860
Hope you know that one command super easy.

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:46.660
Pseudo M K F S will do a
dash t. And then EXT four.

00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:48.580
This is the EXT four file system.

00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:51.880
It's I think the best You can try
other options. But for simplicity,

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:54.100
let's try this and
it'll specify our drive,

00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:57.100
which will be in the dev location
on your Linux file system.

00:29:57.220 --> 00:30:01.510
And then SDB one for me. Whatever
you had when you did L S B L K,

00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:05.710
put it there. Go ahead and do it.
Ready, set, go. It'll take a minute.

00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:09.100
So just a little little coffee
break. Formatting is complete.

00:30:09.105 --> 00:30:11.890
Now we can mount our drive. So real
quick, I'm gonna make a new directory.

00:30:11.895 --> 00:30:16.870
I'm gonna say NK dir slash
mnt slash file cloud.

00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:18.123
That's my new directory.

00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:21.790
I'm gonna check the permissions on that
directory real quick by typing in ll and

00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:22.623
in the directory.

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:27.010
And I can see right here that we'll need
to allow some permissions for our users

00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:29.980
according to this stuff right here. But
we're gonna do this real quick, okay,

00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:32.440
will be pseudo c h mod.

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:36.220
We'll do you for users
plus RW for read and write.

00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:40.750
And then that new directory we just
created Mount or N N T file Cloud

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:44.350
done. Looks good so far. So
now we can mount our drive,

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:46.240
our external drive and it's
really simple to do that.

00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:49.630
It'll be pseudo mount
will specify our drive,

00:30:49.690 --> 00:30:52.270
which was Dev sdd one for me.

00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:55.270
And it'll specify where you want
to mount it in the file system,

00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:59.710
which for us we created a folder
for that already slash nt slash file

00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:03.610
cloud, it's mounted. If we type in
mount, we can check that out real quick.

00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:06.550
There it is. This video has so much
stuff. I hope you're having fun.

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:08.740
Let's check our file permissions
real quick for that folder.

00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:13.120
Once more we'll do ll slash NT slash
file cloud, make sure everything's good.

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:16.450
Looks like we need some work actually
because the Apache service will need to be

00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:18.670
able to read and write to this directory.

00:31:18.670 --> 00:31:20.410
So let's change the permissions
real quick. Once more,

00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:24.220
we'll do pseudo CH mod for simplicity.

00:31:24.225 --> 00:31:29.020
Let's do a for everybody plus read
write and then we'll specify our

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:33.700
directory MT file cloud. Actually
let's set back real quick.

00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:39.070
Let's go back to the beginning of CH
mod and we'll do a dash r dash capital R

00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:41.470
for recursive. Let's add that real quick.

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:45.160
Check our permissions once
more things look a lot better.

00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:48.820
So now here in file cloud, let for our
storage path, let's change it real quick.

00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:53.920
We'll do forward slash mentee slash
file cloud where I have my external

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:58.180
drive mounted. I'll check the
path. Looks good. Awesome.

00:31:58.420 --> 00:31:59.253
Click on save.

00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:04.780
And now we've successfully mounted and
are using an external hard drive with

00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:08.110
file cloud. Felt like a lot. Kind
of was a lot but that's awesome.

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:10.090
Now there's two more things I
wanna show you with File Cloud.

00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:12.130
Two more things we wanna set
up to make it a bit better.

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:15.040
First I wanna get a domain
name and SSL set up.

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:18.430
And second I wanna show you real quick
how we can add a user set up our phone

00:32:18.435 --> 00:32:22.300
and everything with File Cloud and the
coolest feature by far mounting a network

00:32:22.305 --> 00:32:24.250
share like you're there,
like you're anywhere,

00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:27.430
like you can go anywhere and have this
network share mounted. It's so cool.

00:32:27.490 --> 00:32:31.810
Now this first tutorial is specific to
AWS or if you're just hosting File Cloud

00:32:31.815 --> 00:32:34.630
externally in some other cloud
that's publicly accessible,

00:32:34.690 --> 00:32:36.040
it has a public IP address.

00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:39.740
We want to get that sucker a
domain name and enable ssl.

00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:43.280
Now for that I'm going to assume that
you already have a domain name and if you

00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:44.000
don't already have one,

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.600
I've got other videos that'll show you
how to get a domain name pretty cheaply

00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:51.170
and pretty awesomely. And you're gonna
wanna set that up with CloudFlare.

00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:53.570
These are two prerequisites
I'm not gonna walk you through.

00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:57.590
So buy a domain name and set that domain
name up with CloudFlare using it as

00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:58.700
your name server. Again,

00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:01.820
I've got videos somewhere around here
floating around that'll show you exactly

00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:02.480
how to do that.

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:05.090
Now we'll start with our config
and CloudFlare here in CloudFlare.

00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:06.890
We're gonna go to the DNS
settings of our domain.

00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:11.780
Go to records and we're going to add a
new record. This will be a sub domain,

00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:14.630
meaning it's gonna be network chuck.com,
but it'll have something before.

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:18.470
So file do network chuck.com. I'm
gonna call it Hack well files.

00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:23.690
And then we'll point that domain to our
IP address in Amazon or Leno or wherever

00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:27.410
you're hosting your uh file cloud
server. So I'll go back to aws,

00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:32.270
grab that public IPV four address right
here, copy and paste that right here.

00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:35.300
I'll keep the proxy status
enabled and I'll click save.

00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:40.370
So now hack well files.network
chuck.com will forward to my file cloud

00:33:40.370 --> 00:33:41.840
server. But that's just half the story.

00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:46.340
We now need to set up our file cloud
server to believe that's its new name.

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:49.460
That's where you can find it. Now I do
have a link to File Clouds guy below,

00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:51.020
but I wanna walk you through
it real quick. First,

00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:53.090
we'll create a CSR request for File Cloud.

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:56.720
Now if you've never done something like
this, get a certificate signed for ssl.

00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:58.760
It's pretty cool to walk through
this and learn it right now.

00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:02.841
I struggled with this so much in the
beginning of my career, I'm like CSR, ssl,

00:34:02.846 --> 00:34:06.110
what is that? To know this now
is so powerful. So anyways,

00:34:06.115 --> 00:34:08.210
here what we're gonna do, we're
gonna use this command right here,

00:34:08.215 --> 00:34:11.180
which is open SSL to generate a csr.

00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:13.880
You do wanna be logged into
your Amazon e C two instance,

00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:17.720
the terminal to run these commands. I'm
gonna paste that right now. Open ssl,

00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:21.620
let's go. It's gonna ask you to do
some things like where do you live us,

00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:25.520
the country Code State, Texas
City Dallas Company Hack.

00:34:25.525 --> 00:34:28.880
Well now for common name, this
is where you wanna put your url.

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:33.170
So it'll be hack, well what did I
call it again? I don't even remember.

00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:38.120
Oh Hack Well files. Hack well
files do network chuck.com.

00:34:38.150 --> 00:34:41.210
That'll be your common
name. Your CN email address.

00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:47.660
Am I gonna do a password? Keep going and
it's done. Now here if you type in ls,

00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:51.530
you should see a server CSR and
a server key created that csr.

00:34:51.890 --> 00:34:54.800
We want that sucker. We're gonna
cap that server file real quick.

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:59.480
Type in cat server dot csr, there's
our certificate request right there.

00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:02.330
Leave that there, we'll come back in
a minute. Let's go to CloudFlare here.

00:35:02.330 --> 00:35:06.650
I'm gonna navigate over to the SSL TLS
section on the left and go to Origin

00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:07.610
server here.

00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:10.730
I'm gonna get my certificate signed by
CloudFlare and then I'm gonna download

00:35:10.730 --> 00:35:13.040
that. So I'll say create certificate.

00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:16.340
I'm gonna say use my private key in csr.

00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:18.680
Right here is where we'll
paste our certificate.

00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:21.650
If we get back to our terminal here,
we're gonna grab this, copy it,

00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:23.750
paste it right here.
Now here for host names.

00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:26.900
I'm just gonna be very
specific and say File hack,

00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:31.430
well file z network chuck.com
and then click create.

00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:32.600
Now leave that page there.

00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:34.670
We're gonna step forward into
the next steps in our terminal.

00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:37.350
I know this is kind of involved and
other solutions are kind of automatic,

00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:39.960
but it's fun to learn
this manually. It is.

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:44.820
So first thing we'll do is we'll use the
A two e n mod command to enable SSL and

00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:48.930
Apache. So we'll copy that command,
go to our Ubuntu, paste it there,

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:51.120
done next step. Now
getting back to CloudFlare,

00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:54.360
we're gonna grab this certificate file
or this text. We're just gonna copy it,

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:57.450
get back to our terminal and we're
gonna make a new file real quick.

00:35:57.570 --> 00:36:01.140
We're gonna say nano server ct,

00:36:01.770 --> 00:36:05.760
we'll paste that certificate in
there, control X, Y enter to save,

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:06.900
good to go.

00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:09.540
And then we're gonna copy and paste
these commands to make a new directory in

00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:10.800
Apache. We'll paste that first one.

00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:16.680
We'll copy our certificate to that
folder and then we'll copy our server

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:20.640
key, our private key to that
folder. And then one last thing,

00:36:20.645 --> 00:36:24.570
we gotta modify our web server config
and Apache to use this new certificate.

00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:27.210
So the file location is
here. Just gonna grab that.

00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:30.210
I'm gonna type in nano edit that file.

00:36:30.215 --> 00:36:32.220
I'm gonna do a pseudo
before that just in case.

00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:35.700
We're gonna change our virtual
host right here from 80 to 4 43.

00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:40.170
And then just under document
route we're gonna add server name

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:43.410
and then put in the server
name that you set up.

00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:46.800
Mine was hack well files.network

00:36:46.805 --> 00:36:49.080
chuck.com.

00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:54.270
And then just under that we're gonna
copy the SSL engine on paragraph right

00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:58.230
here, paste that right there, make sure
everything's lined up nice and neat.

00:36:58.950 --> 00:37:02.310
Then we'll hit control X Y enter
to save and that should be it.

00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:04.320
All we'll have to do
now is restart Apache,

00:37:04.350 --> 00:37:06.810
which I'll just copy and paste
that command and we should be good.

00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:10.620
So now in theory I should be
able to go out to hack well

00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:15.780
files.network chuck.com and that should
take me right to my file cloud server

00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:19.290
SSL and everything. And it
totally did. That's awesome.

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:21.240
I'm gonna get log into
the admins one once more.

00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:24.870
And there's one thing I wanna
change. It says invalid server url.

00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:29.010
You wanna change that cuz as important
as you share your files and everything,

00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:31.770
they'll have a an URL that
people can access it with.

00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:35.070
And if it's like 1, 2, 7 0 0
1, that's not gonna be great.

00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:36.120
So let's change that real quick.

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:39.420
We're gonna go to settings
here and here under server url.

00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:43.380
We're just gonna change it to
https Hack well files.network

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:48.330
chuck.com. It's gonna check it, make
sure it's all good. Server's valid, save.

00:37:48.450 --> 00:37:50.640
Now before I show you the
awesome network share feature,

00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:53.730
I'm sure you're wondering, Hey
Chuck, I did an on-prem install.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.610
How do I handle SSL and
CloudFlare and all that?

00:37:56.700 --> 00:38:00.000
I would recommend using CloudFlare
tunnels. It's called Cloud Flared.

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:03.840
And I have a video right here of how to
set that up for any service within your

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:04.380
home.

00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:08.940
It basically allows you to open up a very
secure tunnel into your house through

00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:11.340
your firewall and access
all your stuff anywhere.

00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:13.650
Easily do that here with File Cloud.

00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:16.110
I'm not gonna walk through it right
now cause this video's getting so long,

00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:19.170
but it's not very, very crazy different
from what we've been doing here.

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:21.570
Now let me show you real quick
this cool server share thing.

00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:25.380
So first I'm gonna step a new user.
Um, this can apply to anybody anywhere,

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:28.140
whatever installation method you
used, I wanna set up a new user.

00:38:28.145 --> 00:38:32.220
I already had one for Chuck. I'm gonna
add a new one. Add. I'll say Bernard.

00:38:32.490 --> 00:38:35.380
Bernard and I'll create
that user. Awesome.

00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:37.030
Now I'll open up a new incognito tab,

00:38:37.090 --> 00:38:41.320
log in hack well files.network chuck.com.

00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:45.520
It's so cool, this works flawlessly.
Get logged in as Bernard bam,

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:47.740
I'm a new user. I got my
own cloud ready to go.

00:38:47.830 --> 00:38:50.590
Now I can use File Cloud for my
web browser anywhere all the time.

00:38:50.590 --> 00:38:52.660
And it's amazing. But the
apps are what make it shine.

00:38:52.690 --> 00:38:55.840
So here on my dashboard I have the
option to install mobile and desktop apps

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:59.260
right here. I'm gonna click on that.
Now here we have a few options.

00:38:59.320 --> 00:38:59.860
This first one,

00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:04.450
file cloud sync is what you would
see for most Cloud Drive things.

00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:08.230
It'll store your files
both on your computer and
remotely and they'll sync back

00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:12.490
and forth. Pretty cool. But the
drive is what's really neat. &lt;laugh&gt;,

00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:13.990
let's try that out now.

00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:17.890
So I'm gonna click drive and I'll
download this for Windows. I'll launch it,

00:39:17.890 --> 00:39:22.840
install it. You know how installations
work. Pretty basic. I'll restart later,

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:25.720
no big deal. And I'll
launch my file Cloud drive.

00:39:25.725 --> 00:39:28.930
It's kind of hard to say File Cloud to
get started. I'll put in my information.

00:39:28.930 --> 00:39:33.130
So I'll server's already been set up.
I'll log in. You can set a download limit,

00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:36.640
which is cool. And then you choose
your mount. So I'll mount it as,

00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:40.330
let's just say L and bam,
I'm done. Start using drive.

00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:43.390
So it gave me a little recent activity
of how it mounted and it's, it's mounted.

00:39:43.450 --> 00:39:47.050
So check this out, take a file here,
put it in my files, it's there.

00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:49.660
And here are my drive,
map drive. There it is.

00:39:49.810 --> 00:39:51.970
Now what's cool about this is I
can actually share it from here.

00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:56.020
I'll right click that. Click on more
options. File cloud, share link.

00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:58.510
I can just change my share
options right here within &lt;laugh&gt;,

00:39:58.810 --> 00:40:01.900
my stinking file explorer.
That's pretty cool.

00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:06.130
I can say expires tomorrow. I can
restrict it to one download. That's,

00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:10.120
let's do two downloads and then I'll do
a password and then I'll copy that link.

00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:13.090
I'll get email notifications and people
use it. Let's test that out real quick.

00:40:13.570 --> 00:40:16.300
There's the password. Download the file.

00:40:16.330 --> 00:40:19.300
So that feature I don't see anyone else
doing. It's pretty cool. So File Cloud,

00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:22.180
community edition, you're gonna
have a great time. It's really fun.

00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:24.910
Set this up and let me know how
it went for you. Comment below.

00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:28.840
And also if you're a business or maybe
you're thinking about pitching a new file

00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:30.250
solution to your company,

00:40:30.370 --> 00:40:34.090
the enterprise features are what kind
of set File Cloud apart from everybody

00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:37.660
else. Like I said, educational
institutions, financial government,

00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:41.110
all that kind of stuff. They
use this to manage their data.

00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:44.170
It's like here in governance,
which is a very scary word.

00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:48.550
You can pretty much do anything you
want with your data monitor every bit

00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:52.360
&lt;laugh&gt;, like you can do legal
holds, data leak protection.

00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:56.260
You can classify your content,
you can put in retention policies,

00:40:56.650 --> 00:41:01.420
smart D L P, an entire compliance
center for gdpr, hipaa,

00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:05.380
I T A R, &lt;laugh&gt;. It's all kinds of
stuff. You can do workflows if this,

00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:09.310
then that on files. I mean look at the
triggers I have for these workflows.

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:12.220
The file is downloaded, the
comment is added. All these things,

00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:14.620
I mean every little thing you can control.

00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:17.110
And that's killer for a
business and an enterprise,

00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:19.840
not to mention you can integrate it
with everything. Active directory,

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:24.130
single sign-on. You can implement
antivirus scanning on all your data.

00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:27.700
I mean looking at the third
party integrations you can
do, of course antivirus,

00:41:27.730 --> 00:41:31.840
Salesforce Seam, reCAPTCHA,
McAfee, Microsoft Teams.

00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:35.870
You can even enable it. Edit
your files in Microsoft Office,

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:39.410
like if you're in the portal, just
auto open. Now that was File Cloud.

00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:44.030
And I'm now realizing that this video is
so super long &lt;laugh&gt; because there was

00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:45.200
a lot we had to cover.

00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:49.020
And I think File Cloud is amazing because
they focus on one thing and they do it

00:41:49.025 --> 00:41:52.730
great. And that's just file
sharing and data security.

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:56.180
And they do that for enterprises and
they can do it for you in your house.

00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:58.130
That's pretty cool. So that's
the enterprise solution.

00:41:58.430 --> 00:42:03.320
Now let's move on to more of the home
lab open source solution and that's next

00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:05.300
cloud. Now next cloud is
pretty popular already.

00:42:05.305 --> 00:42:08.600
You've probably already heard of Next
Cloud and setting it up is not too bad.

00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:11.120
Now my favorite way to install
Next cloud is through Docker.

00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:14.090
They make it really easy and you can
find Next Cloud in a lot of places.

00:42:14.090 --> 00:42:15.830
By the way, you can run
on your Sonology and nas.

00:42:15.830 --> 00:42:19.250
You can integrate it with True nas. So
it really is a great home lab solution.

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:21.020
So let's try the Docker
install real quick. Now,

00:42:21.025 --> 00:42:24.110
next cloud can only be installed
on Linux-based systems. Again,

00:42:24.115 --> 00:42:26.960
file Cloud is the only one I know of
that can go on Windows. So real quick,

00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:29.600
in Linux we need Docker. Let's
install it, make sure we have it.

00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:34.970
We'll do a pseudo a P T update,
not update, update. There we go.

00:42:35.090 --> 00:42:39.620
And then we'll do a pseudo
APT install docker.io y.

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:43.460
Now we go grab there Docker command,
which you copy and paste this code.

00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:46.190
It's a simple docker run
command, paste it and run.

00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:49.370
It's gonna pull all the necessary
images doing its thing. And that's it.

00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:53.660
Go to https, your IP address or
your domain name, whatever it is,

00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:56.900
port 80 80 From here you
got a weird password thing.

00:42:56.900 --> 00:43:00.170
You wanna copy this little
phrase here. Kebab maturity,

00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:04.040
paste that password in there for the
next cloud A I login. And by the way,

00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:07.100
the reason you can't do anything else
here is because they didn't do a dash D

00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:10.610
for running it as a Damon for Docker.
By default, it's kinda annoying.

00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:11.600
Now depending on your setup,

00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:15.080
you may wanna do a reverse proxy and
refer to the reverse proxy documentation.

00:43:15.110 --> 00:43:17.330
I'm not gonna refer to that
here again because &lt;laugh&gt;,

00:43:17.330 --> 00:43:19.220
my video is already so stinking long.

00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:21.920
But right now I'm running this on LE
Node and LE node's already public.

00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:25.700
And I'm just gonna use the reverse
DNS address I have for Lin node.

00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:27.290
I'll submit that as the url.

00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:30.170
Now next cloud is pretty cool
because they have a ton of features,

00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:34.100
like almost too many. So they uh,
integrate with next cloud office.

00:43:34.105 --> 00:43:37.730
They call collab. You can do next
cloud talk. I don't wanna do that.

00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:39.860
I'm not gonna do the office
thing either. Turn that off,

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:42.320
save changes and then I'll
download and start the containers.

00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:46.880
It's kind of weird how they do it where
it's like you install the installer as a

00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:49.520
Docker container and
then &lt;laugh&gt; and then it,

00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:52.940
the Docker container installs the other
Docker containers. It's really strange,

00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:57.290
right? So that's what it's doing right
now. We'll wait. Okay, it's almost there.

00:43:57.350 --> 00:44:00.320
The yellow means they're starting. So
we're gonna wait for that to finish.

00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:01.250
Now also, while we're waiting,

00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:03.890
the other cool part about Next cloud
is you can install it on pretty much

00:44:03.895 --> 00:44:06.710
anything including a raspberry
pie. They have Next Cloud Pie,

00:44:06.830 --> 00:44:09.470
which will work pretty well.
Now it won't be blazing fast,

00:44:09.475 --> 00:44:10.340
but it does its thing.

00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:13.130
And also one thing you'll want to note
with Next Cloud as I'm watching the

00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:15.980
startup is that it's
very like online service,

00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:18.080
meaning it needs to have an internet
connection pretty much all the time to

00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:18.470
work.

00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:21.620
If you wanna like keep it closed off
on your network without any connection,

00:44:22.070 --> 00:44:24.200
I don't think it works well
with that. I could be wrong,

00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:26.360
but I was reading some documentation
and that's what I found. But anyways,

00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:30.620
it looks like mine is done. Um, there's
my admin user name and then password.

00:44:30.625 --> 00:44:33.930
I'm gonna copy this password real
quick. I'll click on open my next cloud.

00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:37.350
Let's get logged in, get a nice little
graphic meeting. This is pretty neat.

00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:40.470
And notice they try to be, they
try to be everything right? Um,

00:44:40.530 --> 00:44:45.030
you can like have a contacts
and and calendar and and do

00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:49.260
notes. And you've got tasks like
I like what they're trying to do,

00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:53.790
but also I hate it because it's like I
just wanna manage my files and you're

00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:57.990
making this really complex. But files
they can manage and much like File Cloud,

00:44:57.990 --> 00:45:00.810
they have apps for everything
and they do have a drive thing,

00:45:00.815 --> 00:45:03.480
but they don't do that Mapped
drive thing, which I love.

00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:06.960
Now one of the big differences between
next Cloud and File Cloud will be the

00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:11.070
limitations. Next cloud being an open
source solution and much more, you know,

00:45:11.070 --> 00:45:14.850
targeted toward home users. They
pretty much give you everything,

00:45:15.090 --> 00:45:18.810
all the features. So unlimited
users, you can add a bunch of apps,

00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:21.750
like lemme see all the apps, you can add
all the integrations. It's pretty cool.

00:45:21.810 --> 00:45:24.510
And if you're a tinkerer and you love
to just add a bunch of things to your

00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:28.140
stuff and troubleshoot things for
a while, uh, this will be fun.

00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:30.480
And with File Cloud, you're not
gonna see all that file Cloud.

00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:32.400
You actually have a
limitation of five users.

00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:33.660
So if you're gonna be
doing more than five,

00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:35.970
next cloud might be the solution
for you. Unless you're a business,

00:45:35.975 --> 00:45:38.100
then you may want to really,
really consider File Cloud.

00:45:38.190 --> 00:45:40.410
Now Next Cloud does have
similar sharing features.

00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:43.380
When I wanna share a link I can
control, like can they edit it,

00:45:43.470 --> 00:45:45.480
I can hide the download, but
I can't limit the download.

00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:48.210
But I can do things like password
protect and set expiration dates,

00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:51.600
even though I'll note Hi buddy. So
pretty much the same as File File,

00:45:51.605 --> 00:45:55.050
but you can't limit the downloads,
which I don't think anybody else does.

00:45:55.110 --> 00:45:58.320
So I know this video has probably
been so long. I'm exhausted.

00:45:58.350 --> 00:45:59.850
I've been recording for hours.

00:45:59.850 --> 00:46:04.110
But I hope I encourage you to
possibly kick the triad to the curb.

00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:08.580
Now I still use Google Drive and I use
Dropbox. I use 'em as backup. For me,

00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:12.000
I'm comfortable with that decision
cause I like my data being everywhere.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.820
I don't care if they have my
videos, I make those public anyway.

00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:17.040
I just want them backed up in
as many places as possible.

00:46:17.045 --> 00:46:19.710
So I use a little bit of everything.
But now for personal things,

00:46:19.770 --> 00:46:22.710
no I don't put everything up there.
I like control of that. So for you,

00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:25.920
you may want to be very much in control
of your personal data if you're a

00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:26.580
company,

00:46:26.580 --> 00:46:29.910
even more so cuz you may have a ton of
regulations where you can't put your

00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:31.830
stuff up there. So you
have to have that control.

00:46:31.890 --> 00:46:35.520
So solutions like File Cloud specifically
can help you with the business side of

00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:35.970
things.

00:46:35.970 --> 00:46:39.840
And if you're a person who has that
business level of security and fantastic

00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:41.730
file sharing file cloud will be for you.

00:46:41.790 --> 00:46:44.820
And if you're more of a fan
of open source, you like a
product that does a lot,

00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:47.130
next cloud is really fun too.
So I'll leave it up to you,

00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:48.060
whichever one you think,

00:46:48.065 --> 00:46:52.050
but I just want to make sure you guys
know there's an option besides going with

00:46:52.050 --> 00:46:55.140
the triad. It does require a bit
of IT knowledge but of tinkering.

00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:56.550
But we covered that here in this video.

00:46:56.670 --> 00:46:58.470
And please let me know in
the comments what you think,

00:46:58.530 --> 00:47:01.380
what do you use for file sharing,
how do you keep your stuff safe?

00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:03.780
That's all I got. I'll
get you guys next time.
