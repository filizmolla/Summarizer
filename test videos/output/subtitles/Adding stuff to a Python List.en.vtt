00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.810
- Do you know what's more
fun than Python lists?

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.270
Nothing. Not even "Elden Ring," maybe.

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:06.360
But seriously, in this video,

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.610
we're gonna level up
those Python list skills.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.370
We've already seen how we can build a list

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:11.290
in the previous episode,

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:12.927
but now we're gonna add things to it.

00:00:12.927 --> 00:00:16.310
And it's this crazy fun
thing called methods.

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:17.480
Hmm, what is that?

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.313
You're gonna find out.

00:00:18.313 --> 00:00:19.430
So get your coffee ready

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:20.530
or refill your coffee

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:22.580
'cause I've already had like four cups

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:23.422
and let's get started.

00:00:23.422 --> 00:00:24.255
(host sipping coffee)

00:00:24.255 --> 00:00:26.838
(upbeat music)

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.590
Okay, quick sip of coffee

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.290
before we launch our lab. (sipping coffee)

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.123
If you haven't already,

00:00:35.123 --> 00:00:36.080
check that link of the description

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.973
I've got a free Python lab

00:00:36.973 --> 00:00:39.580
that you can use right here
in your browser, right now.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.290
So go ahead and launch it, right now.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:42.930
It's free. And while that lab is launching

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.060
can I show you something really cool

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.893
I've been working on?

00:00:44.893 --> 00:00:45.726
Check this out.

00:00:45.726 --> 00:00:47.360
I've been watching the
Python For Security course

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.500
on IT Pro TV and check this out.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.500
I learned how to build my
own port scanner in Python.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.510
Sure, you can use pre-built port scanners

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.620
but building your own,

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.453
that's just cool.

00:00:56.453 --> 00:00:57.570
If you wanna try it, check it out,

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.403
link below,

00:00:58.403 --> 00:00:59.236
itpro.tv/NetworkChuch

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.658
which by the way IT Pro TV is a sponsor

00:01:01.658 --> 00:01:03.000
of this entire series

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.940
and the reason it can
be free here on YouTube

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:05.773
and not to mention,

00:01:05.773 --> 00:01:07.850
they are my go-to IT training provider.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.300
I use them to learn stuff.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.320
And literally whatever
you wanna learn in IT,

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.000
you can learn it at IT Pro TV

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.200
from just getting your start
with foundational skills

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.740
to more advanced things
like Linux or the CCNA,

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.600
or the DevNet Associate, the CCMP,

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.240
and of course, tons of Python.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.490
And you'll also able to stay
awake during this training.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.510
That's one of the features.

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:25.530
I'm glad they baked that in.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.570
And of course they have virtual labs

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.310
so you can practice all
that stuff you're learning

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.930
and practice tests,

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.560
so you can get ready for any
exam you might be taking.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.440
So if you wanna learn IT like me,

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.610
check it out, link below.

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.470
itpro.tv/NetworkChuck.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.620
If you use code "NetworkChuck"

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.190
you'll get 30% off

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.602
Forever.

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:44.820
So, so here is our gorgeous Python script

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.290
because hey, we're going camping.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.123
You're coming, right?

00:01:47.123 --> 00:01:48.990
Yes you are. In order to
go camping, you need stuff,

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.980
supplies to bring with you.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.640
And we did that in Python.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.660
We put together an amazing Python list,

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.180
full of the stuff that we are bringing.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.310
But you forgot something.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.930
And I can't believe you forgot this.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.850
Come on, get your head on straight.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.840
But seriously, we forgot toilet paper.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.000
Can you imagine what a
disaster that would be?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.580
And actually I'm going to bring a bidet

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.130
because I'm fancy.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.210
So that that'll be for me,

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:09.170
you can use the toilet paper.

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.700
So now our task in this video

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.450
is to somehow, with our
list already created,

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.820
we gotta add toilet paper to our list

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.160
and also a bidet for me,

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.080
'cause I'm I'm bougie.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.410
And this is just one of
the many great things

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.500
about Python list because
we can change these.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.230
We can add things if we forget stuff,

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.930
'cause I forget things all the time.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.680
And apparently you do too, thanks a lot.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.660
I'm just kidding, by the way.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.890
Don't get scared or upset.

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.170
I'm sorry. Anyways, here we go.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.610
So our task of the day

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.960
is to add toilet paper
and a bidet to our list.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:35.950
Now I know what you're thinking.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.687
You're thinking, "Well, Chuck
can't we just go over here,

00:02:37.687 --> 00:02:39.730
"in our list and edit the list manually."

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.227
Like just go over here and go,

00:02:41.227 --> 00:02:43.237
"Toilet paper,

00:02:43.237 --> 00:02:44.070
"they're done."

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.330
No, that's lazy.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.750
We have to do it
programmatically, using Python.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:48.583
Don't do that.

00:02:48.583 --> 00:02:49.960
So we're not gonna do that.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.980
We're gonna use a powerful Python concept.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.970
In fact, new concept time.

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.600
It's a thing called methods.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.850
Professor Bernard, go ahead
and tell us what methods are.

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.110
- [Bernard] A method in Python

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.160
is somewhat similar to a function

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.810
except it is associated
with object/classes.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.630
Methods in Python are very...

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:07.580
- Okay, Bernard, you're done.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:08.413
You're putting people to sleep.

00:03:08.413 --> 00:03:09.246
I'm sorry guys.

00:03:09.246 --> 00:03:10.520
Anyways, let's stop talking about methods

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.410
and let's actually use one

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.830
to add toilet paper and
a bidet to our list.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:14.663
Let's do it.

00:03:14.663 --> 00:03:15.560
It's it's really cool, actually.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.150
This is actually a groundbreaking concept.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.700
You're gonna use a ton in
Python not with just lists.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:20.533
So as you learn this,

00:03:20.533 --> 00:03:22.510
you're getting a head
start to everything else,

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:23.343
which is pretty cool.

00:03:23.343 --> 00:03:25.370
Anyways, here we go. So down
here, type this with me.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.203
Our list up there,

00:03:26.203 --> 00:03:27.265
supplies, go and type it out.

00:03:27.265 --> 00:03:28.310
Supplies

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:29.830
Here comes the method.

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.580
I'm gonna do a dot,

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.610
and then type in a pen.

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.300
Notice, ooh, pretty different color.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.530
When colors change in Python

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:39.550
we know somethings happening.

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:40.710
Something's cooking and brewing

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:41.930
and that's what's happening here.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.810
So just after append, I'm
gonna do a parenthesis and

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.864
inside those parentheses, I'm
going to add our toilet paper.

00:03:48.864 --> 00:03:50.009
Let's go ahead and do
it. We'll do a string

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:52.747
and we'll type in toilet
paper and that's it.

00:03:52.747 --> 00:03:54.840
So let's go and just test the script

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.670
out before I explain what happened here.

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.280
So down here let's go and
print supplies once more

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.086
just like this and
let's run our code, run.

00:04:03.086 --> 00:04:03.919
Look at that.

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:05.750
Okay. So, some magic just happened.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.090
Our list now at the very
end has toilet paper on it.

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.330
Thank goodness for you.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:12.163
I'm using a bidet.

00:04:12.163 --> 00:04:13.910
So let's analyze what happened here.

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.090
This "append" thing is called a method.

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.090
A method is a built in Python tool or

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.000
or function and specifically for list.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.560
It allows us to change
things up with our list.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.640
So with our append method,
obviously we're appending

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.400
or adding an item to our
list at the very end.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.570
And you probably assumed and
you assumed correctly, sir

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.470
ma'am, that the, there are other methods

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.030
and we can do different things to our list

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.310
which we will explore.

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.910
But real quick let's
have you try it yourself.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.730
So here we add a toilet paper.

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.700
You, I need you to
carry it for me, please.

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.970
Can you please add a bidet to
our list just underneath that

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.380
pause the video, unpause, coffee break.

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:49.900
So just under adding toilet paper

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.910
I'm gonna type in supplies

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.940
dot append, once more using
our pen method parentheses

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.660
and then I'll put in
bidet, let's run the code.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.590
Yes. Just like that.

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.490
Not only do we have a toilet paper

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.610
but now we have a bidet
for "Network Chuck"

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.240
Which by the way, I'm not
even kidding about that.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.200
I've got a bidet in every
bathroom in my house.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.850
If you're not using a bidet
what are you even doing?

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:11.240
Okay. Off my soapbox.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.720
Now some of you may have tried this

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:13.830
and it wasn't a bad thought.

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.760
You're probably thinking, Hey,
we don't need an extra line.

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.680
I'll just add two in one append method.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.590
Right? Makes sense to me.

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.410
But if you run our code

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.340
it doesn't work. Using the append method,

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:26.890
you can only add one item

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:29.680
one piece of data at a
time, which honestly yeah.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.620
Is kind of annoying.

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:31.680
So is there a way around that?

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.100
Can we do something else?

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.070
And the answer is yes

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:35.420
there is one other way we can do this.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:36.450
And this one is very handy.

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:37.283
So me back this

00:05:37.283 --> 00:05:40.040
up really quick I'll type
in supplies once more.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.090
And it's another method, who
would've saw that coming.

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:46.410
Right? And this one is
called extend E-X-T-E-N-D.

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:47.680
Did I say that? E-X-T-E-N-D.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.960
There we go. And then of course
our parentheses. Now here

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.210
we're not adding one piece of data.

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:52.960
We're adding multiple pieces of data

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.310
which will come in the form of a list.

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.180
We're actually gonna add
another list to our list.

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.013
Let's try it out.

00:05:59.013 --> 00:06:00.400
And actually I want you
to do it real quick.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.660
So you know, our task bidet
and toilet paper, add that list

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.110
Using the extend method.

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:06.700
It's kind of intuitive, so try it out.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.840
Pause the video unpause, coffee break.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.770
Here's how you would do it
here, inside our parentheses.

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.560
I'm gonna create another
list just inside there.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:14.700
And I'm not actually creating a list.

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.430
I'm just telling it to add this list.

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:17.530
If that makes sense.

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:19.680
Okay. So brackets then a string.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.020
I'll say toilet paper and then comma

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:23.710
one more piece of data, my bidet.

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:24.543
Can't forget that.

00:06:24.543 --> 00:06:25.376
That should do it.

00:06:25.376 --> 00:06:28.180
Now. Let's run our
code, run, that did yes.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:32.700
So with our extended
method, we extended our list

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.410
by adding two items at the very tail end.

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:36.670
Whew, Amazing.

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:38.720
Now can I show you one
more fun way to do this.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.120
Watch this, instead of using extend

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.280
we're gonna use something that
does the exact same thing.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.200
We're gonna add a list to
a list, but we'll do this.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.033
We'll take supplies

00:06:47.033 --> 00:06:52.033
and we'll say supplies equals
supplies, which sounds weird.

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:56.110
Plus, and then we'll do our
list of things you want to add.

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.950
So toilet paper and a bidet,
and if we run our code

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:01.130
it should be the exact same thing.

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:03.450
Fingers crossed, totally is, awesome.

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:04.283
What's happening here.

00:07:04.283 --> 00:07:07.080
First notice that we're not
really using a method anymore.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.760
We're simply using a plus sign addition

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.050
things we've already
covered in this course.

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:12.110
When we try to add two strings

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:13.480
to each other or two integers

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.820
and here we're adding two
list, which is kind of crazy.

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:19.100
So if we look at our
equation, we're saying, Hey

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:21.680
we got this list, name, supplies.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.730
We want this now to
equal the list supplies.

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:27.300
Plus this other list
we're just pulling out

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.940
of thin air, and, it did
it. Adding those items

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:32.530
to the end of the list supplies.

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:36.270
So to sum it all up,
sorry. When you want to

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:38.970
add one piece of data,
which will happen often

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:42.010
especially when we do
something called four loops.

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:44.330
Oh, I that's gonna be fun
coming up soon by the way.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:45.163
If you wanna add one piece

00:07:45.163 --> 00:07:47.180
of data at a time, we'll
use the append method.

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:49.720
So the list, name dot append,
and then whatever you want to

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:50.553
add on the side.

00:07:50.553 --> 00:07:54.760
To add multiple pieces of
data or add a list to a list.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:58.320
We'll either use the extend
method with a list inside

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:01.700
or we can simply add a list to a list.

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:03.640
But wait, there's more.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.190
So what if you don't want to add an item

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:06.760
to the very end of your list?

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:07.660
What if you want it to go

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:10.470
in the beginning or in the
middle or second to last

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:13.160
there is a way there is
a method, a new method.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.780
So let's say that the
bidet is probably the most

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:16.690
important item we have to bring on a trip.

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:18.210
So I want that at the very
beginning of our list.

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:19.250
So we don't forget it.

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:21.600
So I, the bidet added at
the, well, the beginning.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.433
How do we do that?

00:08:22.433 --> 00:08:23.300
Let's try it out.

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:25.350
Here we go type in supplies

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:29.600
our list and then, dot,
in our new method, insert.

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:33.330
Ooh. And let's try it out parentheses.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:34.980
And if I want that data
to go with the beginning

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:35.813
here's what I'll do.

00:08:35.813 --> 00:08:37.600
I'm gonna type in zero, comma,

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.810
and then my piece of data, "bidet".

00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:42.630
So what's happening here because
with this method, it seems

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:44.027
things are a bit different, right?

00:08:44.027 --> 00:08:46.970
We have two arguments that come into play.

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:48.750
The first one is doing something.

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:49.720
We'll talk about him in a bit.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.480
And the second one is our data,
which we already know that.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.900
But this first thing that
is actually something

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:55.733
we've already talked about

00:08:55.733 --> 00:08:58.380
in the first episode of
this talking about list.

00:08:58.380 --> 00:08:59.430
That's our index.

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:00.380
You may have picked up on that.

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:02.740
You may recall that our list are ordered.

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:03.900
They're sequenced.

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:06.150
0, 1, 2, 3.

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:07.310
You got it. They're in order.

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:08.670
And you can reference
that order when you're

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:10.330
trying to pull data out of it.

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:13.380
And now when you're trying
to insert data into your list

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:17.400
so I'm telling this list, Hey
buddy, bidets are important.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:21.300
And I want that bidet to be
at position zero index zero.

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:23.110
When I add the sucker in
there. Now toilet paper

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:25.170
is pretty important, but it's for you.

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:26.710
And I don't really care
about that so much.

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:27.940
So just add toilet paper

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:30.050
to the second to last
position of our list.

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:32.060
Can you do that for me real
quick? and challenge for you.

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:35.320
Challenge, use a negative index.

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:36.720
Can you do it?

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:37.553
Try it out.

00:09:37.553 --> 00:09:38.386
Pause the video.

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:40.530
Unpause, coffee break.

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:42.810
This is a fun one. I love when
we combine multiple things.

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:44.470
Okay? So here's how you would do it.

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:45.880
I'm gonna do another insert method.

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:50.090
So supplies dot, insert parentheses.

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:51.760
Now I position if I want it to be second

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:55.310
from last will be negative, one, comma

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:58.410
And then, my data, toilet paper.

00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:01.210
Let's run our code to see if
it works and boom, there it is.

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:03.680
Toilet paper. Second to last in our list.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:04.940
Now this might have been a bit confusing

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:06.360
because in our previous video

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:09.560
if we wanted to print out
the last item in our list

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:12.700
we would do this: print
supplies, use our brackets

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:16.020
and reference the negative
one index run our code.

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:19.240
Negative one absolutely means
printing out the last item

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.490
'cause there it is right there.

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:21.970
Marshmallows. They're delicious.

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:24.090
However, it's a bit different
when we're inserting data

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:25.570
because normally when
we're just adding data

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:27.690
to our list and we're not
using the insert method

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:29.670
it'll always go down here at the end.

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:31.610
But with insert, If we wanna have it go,

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:33.190
just one before the end,

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:35.450
we're gonna use negative
one and so on and so on

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:37.860
So if we want it to be
third from the last, well

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:39.700
I mean you probably got that, right?

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:41.620
It'll be negative too.

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:43.920
Let's run the code. There
it is. Third from last.

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:44.980
Woo. Okay.

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:46.460
Coffee break. That was a lot.

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:48.390
But I told you right? Way more fun

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:50.720
than Elden ring or whatever
video game you're into.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.110
This is real life, camping

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:54.900
toilet paper, bidets,
Python, man! Love it.

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:57.160
Now right here, you learn the concepts

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.260
but you need to concrete
that into your brain.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:00.480
Solidify it practicing.

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.900
So check out network,
Chuck academy, link below.

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:04.090
We're gonna have extra practice

00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:06.650
extra quizzes to cement
these things into your brain.

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:07.650
In the next episode

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:10.970
we're going to destroy
some things from our list.

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:13.650
Obliterate, blow it up
with some new methods.

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:14.483
It's gonna be fun.

00:11:14.483 --> 00:11:17.590
And by the way, have you hacked
the YouTube algorithm today?

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:18.860
