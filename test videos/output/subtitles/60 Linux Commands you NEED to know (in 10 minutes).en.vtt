00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
Here are the top 60 Linux
commands you need to know,

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.800
and we're gonna do this in 10 minutes.
Our first command can be used anywhere.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.840
It's SSH because you can't use
Linux unless you can get to it.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.080
To connect to your Linux machine,
you'll specify your user it,

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.520
then the ad symbol and then the
server you're gonna connect to.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.000
So I'll copy the IP address of my lin
node that I just set up past that in here.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.720
Hit enter. Accept all fingerprints.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.680
Put your password in and or in the LS
command will list all the files in your

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.560
current working directory.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.160
We can add the L switch to give us a
nice list and we can add the A switch to

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.080
see the hidden stuff. Elix is a big
place. Where are you with the PWD command?

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.120
You can find out print working
directory. It'll tell you where you are,

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.480
but if you don't wanna be there, we
can change that with the CD command.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.520
Change directory. Just after CD
will tell it where you want to go.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.080
Maybe the root of the file system who
we made it guess or we can specify a

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.800
specific path.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.280
With cd.dot we can jump back one
directory and with CD space nothing,

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.120
we can click our heels and get back. Home.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.280
Touch is the quickest and
easiest way to create a file.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.440
Type in touch with a file name
in you got yourself a file.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.800
We can create more than one file.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.920
Every one of those words in that
sentence will be its own file &lt;laugh&gt;.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.560
Or we can do something weird like this
or we could even create a file in the

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.840
future by using the dash D switch and
specifying the date it's created a file

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.720
from the future. And seriously shout
out Tolin for sponsoring this video.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.480
Whenever I need to do anything in Lennox,

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.400
I go Tolin node and spend out the quick
virtual machine to do stuff like this.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.520
And it only costs me 0.01
cents an hour. When I'm done,

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.240
I destroy it and that's all
I'm charged. Check it out.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.640
Link below the Echo command allows you
to talk to yourself or we can use it to

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.880
add stuff to a file really quickly.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.320
We'll specify the right arrow and then a
name of a file, a new or existing file.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.480
But if you really want to
edit a file like a Linux Pro,

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.920
you'll use Nano Nano and
then the file name. And boom,

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.960
we're editing a file to
save your file with Nano,

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.280
you'll hit control x Y and enter to save.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.920
Now if you're Lennox Pro that thinks
you're better than everybody else,

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.040
you'll use them, them the file name
and now you can try to edit a file.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.840
The best way is to hit I to start
inserting text and once you're done,

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.880
hit Escape Colon and wq to write and quit.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.640
Now if you wanna see what's inside a file,

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.280
really quickly use the Cat Command
Cat and then the file name super fast.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.800
And if you don't want anyone to ever see
what's in that file, you can shred it.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.520
Shred the file name and
cat that one. Again,

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.960
nothing looks like a cat road.

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.880
We can make a new directory
with the M K D I R command,

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.320
but right now he's empty, it's lonely.
So let's copy something in there.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.160
We can copy a file of the CP command.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.320
We'll specify our file and then where we
want it to go. If you don't wanna copy,

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.640
you can use the MV command to
move the file, Specify the file,

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.520
you wanna move and then
where you wanna put it.

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.400
We can remove or delete a file with the
RM command and we can remove a directory

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.840
with the RM D i R command.
But if it's not empty,

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.200
we can go back to the RM command and
do a dash R for recursive and try that

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:38.400
done.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.240
We can create a link to a file with the
LM command using the S switch for soft,

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.120
we'll specify the file and then the
link. Now if your terminal's a bit dirty,

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.440
you can clean it off, type in clear.
Ah, so much better Coffee break.

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.000
If you don't know who you are,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.920
you can type in who am I and it'll
tell you existential crisis over.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.680
If you don't like who you
are, you can change that.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.760
Let's first create a new person.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.040
We'll use the ad user command
and then the username, Oh,

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.320
too bad we don't have permission,

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.760
but we have pseudo or psdo specify
pseudo Before your command,

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.120
enter your pseudo password
and you're good to go.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.400
We can also reverse the command by doing
ad user instead of user ad and we'll be

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.480
able to set some parameters
like passwords and stuff.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.200
Now if I wanna become Nick or Austin,

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.800
I can do that with the SU
command for Switch user.

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.640
SU specify the username and I am Austin,
but I don't wanna be Austin anymore.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.560
I can use the exit command, type in
exit back to V and Me. And by the way,

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.000
the exit command can be used
to exit at a lot of places.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.160
Now Nick didn't have a password but I can
change that with the password command.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.160
P A S S W D and then the username.
If you wanna change your password,

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.720
just type in password or password.

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.640
Type into the terminal. Pseudo
password, Millie password,

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.280
but it's so it's just password &lt;laugh&gt;.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.640
Now this next command is kind of
weird and you'll have to install,

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.520
it's called Finger &lt;laugh&gt;.
It's really strange, trust me.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.080
But to install that we'll need to
learn a new command on Debbie and Base

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.400
Machines. We'll use a P t but hold
up. Before we can install anything,

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.880
we have to update our repositories.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.480
So we'll do pseudo a P t update whilst
doing, That'll take a coffee break.

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.600
If you're on Red Hat or sent to West,

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.400
you'll use the Yum package manager and
if you're on Arch or anything else,

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.120
you're on your own. After an update,

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.680
we'll do a pseudo a P T install and the
name of our package which will be finger

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.560
done and now we can use that
command Finger can be used
to inspect another user.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.640
So I might want to inspect
Austin. It's pretty handy.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.080
The Man command will help you with
things you don't know, which is a lot,

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.640
at least for me.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.880
You find out what the finger command
does by doing Man Finger &lt;laugh&gt;.

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.720
That sounds weird. It'll tell us
all about it and how to use it.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.560
Hit Q to get outta there. We
can man Cat, we can man, man.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.040
So when in doubt consult your manual.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.280
Now a faster man is what
is type in what is Finger.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.120
It'll tell you real quick or maybe
you wanna know where finger is,

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.560
you can type in which finger,
which will tell you one place,

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.000
but you wanna know where
all the fingers are.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
So say where is Finger W Get
can help you get stuff from the

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.720
internet. Like maybe you wanna
download the entire Bible in text form.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.040
We can do that right now. And
there it is, the entire Bible.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.720
Another way to download is with Curl,

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.120
my personal favorite type in curl the URL
you wanna download from and then using

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.120
the right arrow, direct that to
something else like a file Done.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.400
Now the Bible's kind of big, what do
you say? We made that file smaller.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.280
We can zip it up.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.240
Zip the zip file you wanna create
and what you wanna zip inside.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.360
Hey that wasn't too bad.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.520
Now often you might want to unzip
something with the unzip command,

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.000
specify that file name and some
other options and you're good to go.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.480
Now if we wanna read our file we could
cat it but that's crazy. Come on.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.960
A better way is using the less
command, giving you one page at a time.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:28.960
Just the way I like it.

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.240
If you only wanna see the beginning
of your file type in head,

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.040
what about the end type and tail?

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.160
If you wanna compare two files
to see if they are the same,

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:40.240
like this guy and this guy, use
these CMP command for a compare.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.000
Specify your two files and hey,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.120
we do have a difference but it didn't
tell us what it only told us where for

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.800
that we can use the diff command specify
files and it will tell us exactly

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.400
what's different. You decide what's true,

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.080
the sort command will sort your
stuff alphabetically. So for example,

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:55.040
I could cat the Bible,

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:59.520
do a pipe and type in sort at the end
the entire Bible in alphabetical order

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.600
ending with Zephaniah.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.840
The fine command is nuts and will help
you well fine things type in fine.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.440
Specify what directory you wanna look in.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.680
I'm gonna look in all of them and then
specify a name of a file with a regular

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.000
express BAM files found. You
can also find all hidden files,

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.440
empty directories or all executable
files. And speaking of executable,

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.800
how do you make a file executable?

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.360
We'll change the attributes with the CH
mod command and do a plus x and then the

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.720
file name and now it executes.

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:28.480
We can change the ownership of that
file with the CHONe command or change

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.600
ownership. Specify the user and
then the file. Congrats Austin,

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.680
you own a file time for some network
stuff. Copy break. What's your IP address?

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:39.120
I have config. If you don't have
it, install it. Let's try it again.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.680
If F conf fit, there it is.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.680
You could also try IP address
which makes more sense.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.320
Same information just better.

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.280
Now what if you only wanna
see it for one interface?

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:52.080
For that we can use GR grip is crazy.
I love gr same command IP address.

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:56.360
For this time I'll use a pipe type inre
and say Ethan Nets zero to only see

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.600
Ethan at zero's IP address. Bam.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.720
We could grip again do another pipe
grip for ANet and it only shows you that

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.640
line. But what if we only wanna
see the IP address for that?

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:08.120
We can use a A is even crazier than gre.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:12.680
Just after our grips I'll A this put
in a crazy regular expression and get

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.840
exactly what I want. Now what
about dns? What's our dns sir?

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.640
One way is we can cat it.

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:22.120
Cat the et tc resolve with no e.com file.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.160
But if you're on newer
versions of things like Ubuntu,

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.280
you might see something like
this not very informative.

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:31.200
Instead we can type in resolve
with an E CTL status and there

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.840
it is. Now is your website
up? We can find out with Ping.

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.720
We can find out if anything's up with
ping ping and then the name of the

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:40.280
website. Get responses
forever. Hit control C to stop.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:43.680
We can limit that with a dash C command
specifying the count of things we wanna

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.600
send just five. We can specify
the size of the packets.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.520
If you wanna see the path through the
internet you're taking to get to a

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.400
website, you can use the trace
route command, which is so cool.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:57.040
Trace route and then the name of the
site telling you every haw and that

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.400
latency. Now what ports are
open on your Linux machine?

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:03.200
We can check it out with netstat net
Statistics, this gives you a lot.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:07.000
Do you not wanna try netstat dash
two lupin, all those switches,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.360
which is much better. A more
modern version is the SS command,

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.320
which is basically the same thing.

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.240
Use a topen switches and it's nice and
pretty. Now what about your firewall?

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:17.720
Are things getting through
or do you wanna block 'em?

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:20.480
If you wanna to allow pour 80,
you could run something like this,

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:23.920
which is honestly kind of complex.
That's why U F W is way easier.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.680
This sits on top of IP tables
and makes it so much easier.

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:28.080
If I want to allow pour 80,

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:31.840
just do U F W allow 80 as psdo

00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:35.280
done. See what you're
allowing with U FW status,

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.080
which right now it's not even enabled.

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:40.480
So we can enable it with U F W enable.

00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:42.880
Then check our status
once more. Beautiful.

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:45.800
Now if you wanna know a bit more about
your system, you can use the you name,

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:50.280
command, you name. It'll tell you just
a little bit. If you type in dash A,

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:53.600
it'll tell you a lot. Now if you
want a prettier version of all this,

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:56.200
try Neo fetch. Going  to
install that real quick.

00:08:56.750 --> 00:09:01.520
A t install neo fetch and then simply
run Neo fetch. And how pretty is that?

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:04.120
The Cal command will give you
a quick little calendar here.

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:06.520
I don't know why you want that, but
it's kind of cool. If you don't have it,

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.720
you can install it with
pseudo A P t install n cal.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.520
If you wanna do some math
right here in your terminal,

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:14.840
you can echo a problem out to bcbc
will tell you what the answer is.

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.520
If you wanna check on your memory and
see how much memory you have available on

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:18.920
your system, just type in free.

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.200
It'll tell you what's used and
what's going on with your swap.

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.760
How much  space do you have?

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:27.000
You can use the DF command
and more specifically the
DF dash capital H command.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.120
You're gonna use that one all the time.

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:30.360
What about the stuff running
on your system? The processes?

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:31.680
We can use the PS command,

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:35.520
which won't tell you much unless
you use the PS A U X switch.

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:36.920
Then we can get all the goodies.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:39.920
If you wanna see the processes eating
up all your stuff, type in top.

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:44.160
If you wanna see that in a prettier way,
type in H top &lt;laugh&gt;, that's slick.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:47.120
If you have a process
that you want to kill  it,

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.920
we can do that with the kill command
first we have to find the process id.

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:53.840
I'll do that with ps. I'll grip for
that script I wanna kill. There it is.

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:58.200
There's this process ID and I'll kill
the process with the dash nine signal

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:03.160
forcibly killing it. And then the process
ID 66 59. Goodbye buddy. He's gone.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.440
Now. Even better than kill
is P kill because you don't
need to know the process.

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:10.320
ID type in  kill, use the F
switch and specified the name.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.200
You kind of think it is
and it did it to stop,

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.440
start and restart services
or Damons and Linux.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:18.920
You can use the system CTL command at
your systems using System D. If not,

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:23.240
it'll be using service. So to stop a
service system ctl, we do Apache two.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.720
Replace  with start.
We'll start the service,

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:28.640
type in status to see what's
going on or do a restart.

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:29.960
Now we've gone through a lot of commands.

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:34.360
If you want a history of all we did type
in history and that's a lot of stuff.

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:38.840
And finally, if you wanna reboot
pseudo reboot. If you wanna shut down,

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:43.120
pseudo shut down. This will shut down
your machine in about one minute.

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:46.840
If you want to do it now, do
a dash H now, which I'll do.

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:49.280
That's the end of the video.
Talk to you guys later.
