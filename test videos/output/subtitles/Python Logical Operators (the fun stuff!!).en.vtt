00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.280
Stop before you watch this
video, we gotta do this.

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.000
If you like Python. Cool. And.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.800
You enjoy coffee. Continue. Let's do this.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:11.223
Else.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.280
I wasn't prepared for this.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.173
Why are you here?

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.270
Welcome to episode six of
my Python right now, series,

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.430
where I'm gonna teach you everything
you need to know to become dangerous and

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.830
Python in this episode. Woo. Get ready.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.910
We're gonna get more control over
our Python programming. And so far,

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.270
we've done great job because we've kept
evil Ben from coming into our coffee

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.790
shop, but we have a new problem, evil Ben,

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.820
the only person we have to worry
about now, now we have evil, Patricia.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.093
Patricia.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.740
Get it together, sweetie. We have a.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:48.180
Show this weekend,

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.580
evil Patricia is way worse than Ben and
we have to keep her from entering our

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.820
coffee shop. But to do this, we
have to gain some new skills skills.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.860
We're gonna talk about here in this video.
We're no longer looking for just Ben.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.180
If name equals Ben.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.130
Now we're like if name equals
Ben and also Patricia, how,

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:07.170
how are we gonna do that? It's a thing
called logical operators and yeah,

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.370
they're fun. So get ready.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.450
And the best part is you don't
need a dang thing to do this.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.730
Just like every episode in this course
you'll have access to a free Python lab

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.810
right here in your browser. So check that
link below and get signed up. And uh,

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.400
oh, you know what? Forgot one
thing. You need coffee by now.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.560
You should know that. I mean,
how else did you get past my,

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.560
if statement at the beginning
of this video, if you're here,

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.840
you already have coffee, right?

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.000
And a massive shout out to our
sponsor of this entire series.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.040
And the reason it can be free
here on YouTube, it pro TV.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.320
If you really wanna get serious about
your it career, or you're like, Hey,

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.320
I want to get into it. You need to
check out it pro TV. They're the,

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.790
by just by far the best
learning platform out there,

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.990
I use it pro TV to keep myself up to
date on all the new technologies and just

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.070
to learn new stuff, wherever
you're at in your it journey.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.310
They have you covered from foundational
skills. If you jump in there real quick,

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.750
dude, check this out. That's
pretty slick. So it fundamentals.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.710
Stick your toe in the water of it.
Then build up some Linux skills,

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.340
routing and switching customer
service mean, dude, this is so cool.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.740
So for those of you who ask me,
Hey, how do I get started in it?

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.820
Follow this stinking path right here.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.860
Because not only will you
get to learn a ton of stuff,

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.020
but you're doing things hands on. They
have hands on labs built into this,

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.060
which is really handy when you go for
the more advanced things like, uh,

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.933
I don't know, Python,

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.460
if you wanna learn more Python
than what I'm showing you here,

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.330
they have a ton of stuff. Python
or networking, Python for security,

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.010
where to go. Yeah. Right here. And pretty
much anything you want to learn in it.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.250
So if you're ready to take
your it career seriously,

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.290
and you wanna learn it like me, check it
out. Link below, use the code network,

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.930
Chuck, and you'll get 30% off Forever.

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.000
So do it now anyways back learning
Python. Okay. Let's get started.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.800
So if you haven't already opened up
a lab for Python episode six day one,

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.520
and you're like, I don't
know where that is.

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.240
Well then check the link below and get
signed up, man. Come on. It's free now.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.700
So far,

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.960
our robot barista bouncer is doing a
fantastic job and we did a great job in

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.240
telling him how to do a great job because
in the last few videos we said, Hey,

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.120
let's do some if statements to figure
out and filter through the evil bends.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.920
If their name is Ben and they are
evil, cuz not all Bens are evil.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.760
Remember they can come in. But now, now
we got a different problem. Don't we?

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.310
Because evil, Patricia is on
the scene are her robot barista.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.230
Bouncer is not prepared to prevent
evil Patricia from coming in.

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.750
So we gotta change that right
now. So if we look at our code,

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.790
we can see that we're already saying,
Hey, if the variable name is equal to Ben,

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.310
if that evaluates too true, then
kick him out. Or also if he's evil,

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.750
but now we have to evaluate, Hey,
not only does name have to equal Ben.

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.740
It also could Patricia then kick
her out too, to do that new concept,

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.540
tie something called logical
operators and watch this.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.820
This is pure magic and it's so
simple, too elegant over here.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.140
Let's go ahead and do this
together where it says,

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.460
if name equals Ben right before our colon,

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.380
let's get a space and then
we'll put in this type in or,

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:04.170
or check that out as we finish
that R it changed colors and now we

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.130
can type in name equals
the string. Patricia.

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.210
Ooh, powerful. Right? With one simple.

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.810
If statement we're evaluating,

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.320
if one thing is true or something
else is true. If Ben comes in,

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.800
dude, this is true. If Patricia
comes in, dude, this is true.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.440
And now we have the power to kick
Patricia out. Let's test it out.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.960
Let's run our code. Click
on run. What's your name?

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.520
Let's test our code real quick. Let's
say our name is Ben. Ben. I'm evil. Ben.

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.240
I'm not welcome here. Get
out. Let's run it again.

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.190
Let's test an average person like
camera. Cameron's a good guy, right? Oh,

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.550
Cameron came right in. But now let
me stop that script. The beard thing.

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.550
We'll we'll talk about that here
in a bit. Let's run it again.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:52.310
This time we are evil Patricia. So
my name's Patricia, are you evil?

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.910
Yeah, we got it. And again,

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.630
this is so cool because we don't have
to have name equal both Ben and Patricia

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.620
and know it can be either
or so powerful man.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.220
So many use cases and I may have
noticed, and this is kind of annoying.

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.980
It's annoying to me anyway, uh, here
in our print message. We're like,

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.540
you're not welcome here,
Ben, but that was Patricia.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.580
Patricia at this point is super
confused. Like I'm not Ben. I am evil.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:17.940
I am Patricia, but I'm not Ben.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.220
So real quick use your skills that you've
learned so far in this course and fix

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.010
that for me real quick,
pause and UN pause.

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.930
Let's fix super simple. Right? If you
watched all the previous episodes,

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.290
we basically have to do what we're
doing here in our L statement.

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:34.210
We have to use the name variable and
connate that with our print statement.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.890
So I'll do that real quick.
Instead of putting Ben right here,

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.050
we're gonna move all that right there.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.930
I'll make that first part of
string on its own. And I'll say,

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.760
plus the variable in name, but should be
Patricia or Ben plus the other string.

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.080
We're concatenating, all kinds of stuff
all over the place. Five Ben, Patricia,

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.880
and we'll yell at her. Get out of
here. Good work. Let's try it out. Oh,

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.640
forgot my closing pro on
the print statement. There
we go. Run. I am Patricia.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.440
I am indeed evil. I was like, wait,
what? Why does he Patricia twice?

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:04.680
I just realized what I did here.

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:09.160
That's what happens when you try to
teach and type. Now let me run that.

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:11.680
That was weird. Perfect. That works now.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:16.280
So we cover the logical operator or
super powerful, but not the only one.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.070
And it's a good thing because we have
another case we have to look at here.

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.910
Another requirement for our robot,
barista bouncer. The other day,

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:24.550
I was watching Lokey on Disney.
Plus you ever seen it? It's amazing.

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:26.990
And in watching that show,
I realized that being evil,

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.710
isn't black and white look because Lokey
does bad things. He certainly is evil,

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.950
but he also does good things, which
that reminds me Lokey is totally evil.

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:38.740
So if Lokey ever comes to our coffee
shop real quick challenge for you.

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:42.540
Let's make sure Lokey
that's a different color.

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:45.940
Let's make sure Lokey can't come in. Can
you add that to our script? Real quick,

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:51.060
pause the video. See what you got. UN
pause. I'm gonna add it real quick.

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:55.740
This is what you would do.
Ben or Patricia or? Yeah,

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:59.130
you could do another or three or, or no,
that's only two, two ORs. I can count.

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:02.810
I promise name equals Lokey.
Let's try that out real quick.

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:08.370
Lokey comes in. Yeah. He's evil. Got
it. Okay, cool. So back to my story.

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:09.970
Yes. Lokey is evil,

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:13.090
but sometimes he does good things
and I want to account for that.

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:15.410
I wanna factor that in. So
essentially here's what I want.

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:17.410
We're gonna make this super
complicated cuz we have to we're it.

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:21.800
People here know I want, if Ben comes
in and Ben is evil, he answers. Yes.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:25.520
And let's say if he's done four or more
good deeds that day he can come in.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.560
Even if he is evil. So
how would we do that now?

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.960
I know things are getting a bit confusing.

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:34.120
That's why we're going to flow chart
mode. Here we go. Flow charts. Dun dun,

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:35.760
dun. It's not scary at all.

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:38.320
So here is the logical view of
what we're doing in our script.

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:42.310
What's your name is your name? Ben.
Patricia. And also Lokey. Let me add that.

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:45.590
If the answer is no, then come
on in. If the answer is yes,

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:50.710
let's make sure you're not evil. Are
you evil? No. Come on in. Yes. Get out.

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:53.230
But now we wanna say with our new logic,

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:57.790
how many good deeds have you done today?
If less than four, get outta here.

00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:02.060
You're still evil. But if you've done
four or more good deeds, then Hey,

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:06.620
come on in. I can work with that.
I love me some anti heroes. Yeah.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.540
Now this should be a fun one because
you can do this in probably a million

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:10.280
different ways,

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:13.860
but I wanna challenge you to use
logical operators to make this happen.

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:17.340
I remember so far we've already
covered the or logical operator and,

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:19.220
but let me introduce a new
one to, for you real quick.

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:20.850
And I'm not gonna tell you how to use it.

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:23.010
Cause I think it's kind of intuitive
and I want you to try it out.

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:25.410
Just mess with it and
break it. Another one is,

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:30.570
and I want you to try and use
the and logical operator. Oh,

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:31.350
and also let me do this.

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:35.610
I'm gonna put you into a tighter box on
what you can do. Only change this one.

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:40.010
If statement to make this
happen. Only that one. Okay.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:45.010
For go pause me and see
what you got. UN pause.

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:47.330
Let's work through this real
quick. So here at our task,

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:49.370
we pretty much have two things
we have to accomplish. First.

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:52.010
We have to find out, Hey, how
many good deeds have Lokey,

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:54.930
Patricia or Ben completed today?
And just like their Eagle status.

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:58.560
All we have to do is just ask them
because why would they lie about that?

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:01.600
Duh man, they're they're not
crazy. They're just evil.

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:06.040
So just under evil status,
we'll set a new variable.

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:10.560
We'll call it good underscore deeds
and we'll have that equal and input

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:13.200
cuz we're gonna ask them, Hey,

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:17.790
how many good deeds have you done today?

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:20.830
And we'll do a little back
slash and end to make it pretty,

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:24.470
put some space there, but hold up
quick quiz. This ain't gonna work.

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:27.670
And why and yeah, I did say ain't
it's okay. Why won't this work?

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:31.870
It's because again, the input
function will use a string by default.

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:33.110
We have to convert that to an integer.

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:36.780
So we'll just wrap that little
input by function there with an

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:40.460
integer function around it. Perfect.

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:43.660
So now how many good deeds they have
done will be stored any good deeds

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:45.620
variable. So now for the
second part of this task,

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.700
we need to add some logic
here. So let's get to our,

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:51.580
if statement over here and make some
changes. So just after this, yes,

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.020
I'm gonna put a new operator in. We
just talked about it. It's going to be,

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:58.930
and so I'll go a and D color change.
We know something's happening,

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.090
magic's happening hit space.

00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:05.250
And I'll see if Eagle status
is yes and good deeds.

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:09.730
And I'll use one of our comparison
operators less than four.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.810
That should do it. Yeah. I think
you should do it. So check it out.

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:13.290
Here's what's happening in order for this,

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:18.280
if statement to evaluate to
true both the evil status must

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:23.200
be yes. And their good deeds
must be less than four.

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:26.160
So if they're evil and they've
only done two good deeds, then bam,

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:30.680
this statement's true. And will print,
get your stinking, hide it outta here.

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:33.560
You're not welcome. You're two evil
for this place, this establishment.

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:35.720
And that's what the and
operator does for us.

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:40.630
It's not just saying this or this either
could be true saying both of these

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:43.310
suckers have to be true in
order for us to continue.

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:47.190
So let's try it out real quick. Run
this time. I'm just gonna be a lowkey.

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:50.550
Why not? I'm lowkey am
my evil. Of course. Yes.

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:55.070
But how many good deeds have I done
today? Let's say we've we've been good.

00:10:55.330 --> 00:11:00.300
We did seven good deeds
today. We made it in. Yeah,

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.300
we were evil, but Hey, we made up
for it. That's how that works. Right?

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:05.500
I don't know. Probably not,

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.380
but now I'll see what happens if we didn't
do enough. Good deeds. Let's run it.

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:12.460
What's my name. I am Patricia.
Am I evil? Of course I am.

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:16.460
How many good deeds I've only done two
good deeds today. I now welcome here.

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:19.810
Less than four D who man,
take yourself a coffee break.

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:21.770
Cuz right now with the power of Python,

00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:25.770
we saw the problem of evil
kind of, we didn't solve it.

00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:29.610
We were able to detect if evil people
are walking into our coffee shop and now

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:32.450
our robot bar a bouncer is doing
a killer job, but also real quick,

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:35.530
I kind of have a, a brain
breaking scenario here. It's
gonna hurt a little bit.

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:39.320
So we covered the or
logical operator and the,

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:43.080
and logical operator. But there's another
one that I don't really use often,

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:44.300
but it's there.

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:47.040
But I think it's worth mentioning cuz
it'll help you understand if statements

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:51.520
even more. And this is the not
operator now to talk about this,

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.960
let's go ahead and launch
lab two for this episode,

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.560
episode six and we got a bit
of a clean slate here and here.

00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:59.920
We're gonna use the same logic as before.
If Ben comes in, don't let him in.

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:02.400
And we strip things down. It's very
simple here so I can illustrate this.

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:07.400
My pen. Sorry, evil. Ben strikes
again. That rhymed a lot anyways.

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:09.920
And I'll just run the code just to
make sure it works. What's your name?

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.280
My name is Ben. Get
outta here. Very simple.

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:16.510
Now I wanna do something with
our not logical operator.

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:20.790
I'm gonna throw 'em in right here.
Let's try it out. This is so weird.

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:25.030
It really is. If not
notice that change color.

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:29.030
It's a real logical operator. If not
name equals Ben, what's gonna happen.

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:33.580
Well only one way to find out, right? And
also guess what you think will happen.

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:35.780
Positive video. Think about
it. I'm not gonna wait for you.

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:38.780
Let's run the code right now. Run.
What's your name? Let's try Ben.

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:43.260
Come on in what just happened?
Well with our, if statement,

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:48.180
what we're saying is if the name
doesn't equal, Ben, then do this.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.500
If it does equal Ben, then do this.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:53.300
So we just basically did the opposite
of what our original statement said.

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:58.410
If net equals bend, do this. Now we're
saying if name not equal, Ben do this.

00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:01.370
Now, if that broke your
brain a bit, me too,

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:05.410
because even now I have to sit here and
go, wait, wait, if not, okay, I got it.

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:06.290
Now it takes a bit right?

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:10.250
And I think it might help if we talk
about bulls to make it make more sense.

00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:11.810
Let me explain this whole time.

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:15.120
When I've been talking about controlling
the flow of bar Python programming,

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:16.720
we've been dealing with
if statements, right?

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:21.200
We'll say if whatever this junk is
evaluates to, what do we say? True.

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:24.200
Do something. If the statement's
false, do something else.

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:28.200
These two bits of data here
true and false are what we call

00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:31.280
boos, which I don't know
why, but when I say boos,

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:33.600
it makes me hungry and I really
don't have a reason anyways.

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:37.910
So I'm probably gonna eat after this
video. And boos is actually a data type.

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:39.390
So let's play with them
for a second. Let's do it.

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:41.550
So right here in our terminal
here, I'm gonna clear my stuff out.

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:44.830
Did you know that we can actually just
type stuff in our terminal and do Python

00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:47.590
in real time? So do this. I
want you to set a new variable,

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:51.270
say the variable me and have
that equal your name. So for me,

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:54.790
it'll be network check the string
network. Check for you. It'll be Bob or,

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:59.580
or Ben, sorry, Ben. I set that
variable. Bam. So right now,

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:00.280
while we're in this terminal,

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:02.460
in the context of just being
here before we reset it,

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:05.780
that's where the variable
equals me is you. Huh?

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:08.900
So if I call that variable just by
typing in me, it calls network. Chuck.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.260
Now try this type in me and then
do double equal sign equals equals

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:16.650
do a space and let's do the
ring of your name network,

00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:19.050
Chuck that we just did before.
So the same exact thing before,

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:20.490
but we have one extra equal sign.

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:24.490
What do you think will be the output
here it out. True. How cool is that?

00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:28.290
Because the double equal sign is
evaluating. If something is true or false.

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:31.370
And we said, Hey, does
me equal network Chuck?

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:35.530
And because we just said it there, it
totally does what happened. My voice just,

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:37.400
I don't don't know what
happened now let's try this.

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:40.120
I want you to print the
type of that data. Now this,

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:43.000
if you recall back from one of
our earlier episodes, we did that.

00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:46.960
Let's try it real quick here.
I'll say print parentheses type.

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:48.800
We're printing our type function.

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:52.880
Parentheses me equal equals network.

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:56.680
Chuck I'll close out my string of the
quote then parenty and I think I need one

00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:58.960
more parentheses. Yes. Okay,
cool. So we're all good.

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:01.600
When I print the type of
that data, check this out.

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:05.360
A new data class and earlier
episodes, we saw strings,

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:08.000
we saw integers and we saw floating
point numbers and all kinds of stuff.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:12.150
I think, think just those three. Now
we have the Julian true or false.

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:15.230
And that's the data type we're working
with when we're dealing with lot of

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:18.470
widths. I just said if statements,
so now one more thing, try this.

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:21.030
I want you to do me once more.

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:25.830
We'll do our equals equals our
comparison operator and compare that to a

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:29.270
false thing. I'll do Nick. I'll do one
for you, Nick. Like Nick, I'm not Nick.

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:32.780
So when I run that is pairing the
me variable to Nick and saying, Hey,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.660
is this me variable equal Nick,
it should return false. Right?

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:40.980
And it certainly does. That's a false
statement, but now let's break your brain,

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:45.460
hit the up arrow and bring that up again.
Put that knot operator in front of it.

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:49.900
That not logical operator, not me
equals Nick. What will that evaluate to?

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:54.850
Let's try it out. True. It's not, it's
just a better way to understand it.

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:56.250
Play with it, play
around with things here.

00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:59.730
The reason this evaluated to true is
we're saying, Hey, is this statement true?

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:03.290
Is me not equal to Nick? It's
kinda like you saying, Hey,

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:07.970
I don't not want coffee. Right? That's
kinda, that's kinda what it is in Python.

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:10.450
Not me equals Nick. Not
one more quick, fun thing.

00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:11.930
Last thing I promise here in our script,

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:16.120
I use the knot to basically do the
opposite. Is the name not equal to Ben?

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:18.560
There's actually another way to do
it. And a more common way to do it.

00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:22.600
It's actually something I use more
often take the knot away, no more knots.

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:24.760
And let's work with our
comparison operator,

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:28.920
remove your equals and let's
do exclamation point equal.

00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:32.240
Sign that right there. Pretty much
accomplishments. The same thing.

00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:33.830
We just use a logical operator.

00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:35.910
Now we're using a comparison
operator to do the same thing.

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:40.510
This means not equals. If name does not
equal Ben, then that makes more sense.

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:43.710
Right? I feel like if saying, if not
name, that's like speaking pig Latin,

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:47.070
but if we run it again, it does the
same thing as not right. Who, okay,

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:48.170
one more coffee break.

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:51.430
Cuz that was crazy because now don't
you just feel more powerful in Python

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:55.140
because now you can control the
flow of your programming comparison,

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:59.380
logical conditional operators to just
do all kinds of stuff and don't stop

00:16:59.380 --> 00:16:59.880
there.

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:03.940
I'm gonna have in the link below some
challenge labs for you to complete and

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:07.500
accomplish because honestly with Python
and programming and anything in it,

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:10.700
pretty much anything in life
repetition will help you get there.

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:13.460
It'll cement those ideas
into your brain before law.

00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:16.170
I'm gonna be coding like a wizard
anyways. That's episode six.

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:20.170
That's all I got massive. Shout out to
it. Pro TV, the sponsor of this video,

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:23.090
the series. The other reason,
this is free on YouTube here.

00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:24.330
So if you haven't already check them out,

00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:28.610
if you wanna study it like me and
get 30% off forever use code network,

00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:32.170
Chuck and also, Hey, have you
hacked the YouTube algorithm today?

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:35.520
Just make sure you do at that like
button bell comment. Subscribe.

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:39.360
You gotta hack YouTube today.
Ethically of course. And yeah,

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:42.120
that's really all I got. I'll
catch you guys next time.
