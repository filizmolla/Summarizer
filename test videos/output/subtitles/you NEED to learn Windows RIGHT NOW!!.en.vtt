00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.360
You need to learn Windows right now. No,
you really do. And let me tell you why.

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:08.280
Microsoft Windows is everywhere. It
has over 75% of the desktop market,

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.810
meaning out of all the desktop OS is out
there, 75% are using Microsoft Windows.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.390
And that's a lot of people
and a lot of businesses.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.540
And that's the biggest thing I wanna
focus on. Why does that matter? Why?

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.150
Why do you care? Jobs
if you want a job in it,

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.230
knowing Windows from the admin
support perspective, it's required.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.110
Especially if you're just starting out
trying to get that first job in it.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:29.731
Usually help desk and think about it.

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.100
It just makes sense if
most companies use Windows,

00:00:32.105 --> 00:00:36.060
most companies need people like you
with Windows skills. And by the way,

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.730
I'm not just talking about, oh,
I've launched Command Pro before.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.990
I mean actually knowing Windows, how
to support it, administer it, fix it,

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.330
break it. And speaking of
breaking, that's another thing.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.000
If you wanna become a
hacker, ethically, of course,

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.070
how can you not learn windows?

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.250
Most of the time it's gonna be the thing
that you're hacking and you can't hack

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.010
it if you don't know it, you can't
hack it. Like seriously took this up.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.670
I'm going for this new
hacking certification from
Hack the Box called the CPTs

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.080
so I can become less of a hacking new
and look at the prerequisites windows.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.820
So you gotta know Windows.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.760
And in this video I'm going
to introduce you to Windows.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.920
And you may think you already
know Windows, you don't.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.530
There's a big world of Windows
that you haven't even thought of.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.170
And that's what we're covering in this
video. It's more than just a desktop.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.750
You play games on or run Excel.
I don't know what users do.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.510
And then I'll also show you
what it means to know Windows,

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.960
the difference between having user
knowledge and having admin knowledge,

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.630
which is the knowledge you'll get paid
for by companies. That's what you want,

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.960
right?

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.440
I'll also show you how you can start
building out your own Windows lab because

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.450
you gotta have that. If you
wanna learn something in it,

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.520
you have to play with
it. You have to break it.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.110
And even if you're a Mac and Linux user,

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.360
I'm gonna show you how to get
access to this. And finally,

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.540
if I convince you to learn Windows
and you wanna learn it as a skill,

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:46.920
I'm gonna show you some resources,

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.920
courses and certifications that you
can take that will teach you Windows.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:50.430
And by the way,

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.580
I'm creating a little Windows Fundamentals
course right now that you can check

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.100
out, lean Below. But I'll talk
more about that here in a bit.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.020
Now we're gonna cover a
lot. So before we do that,

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.590
let's take a quick coffee break and talk
about something a little controversial.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.190
Kind of the elephant in the room.
Windows is really insecure, right?

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.130
Like people who are using Windows
are always getting hacked. Yes,

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.380
I'll give you that. Windows
people are always getting hacked,

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.980
but it's not because Windows is
insecure, it's because it's popular.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.670
If you're a hacker writing malware,
you're gonna write malware for the masses.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:21.960
So as a Windows user,

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.250
what can you do to protect the most
targeted OS in the world? Use nor vpn,

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.500
the sponsor of this video. Now
I know what you're thinking.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.760
Why &lt;laugh&gt; doesn't make any sense,
nor VPN is just a nor vpn, right?

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.120
How's it gonna protect me against malware
and phishing attacks and all these

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.540
nasty things coming out? My Windows
pc, it's just a vpn, right? No,

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.330
actually not. If you haven't
looked at norv PN in a while,

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.790
it's got a few new tricks
of its sleeve. For example,

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.540
they've got threat protection now. So
in addition to being the fastest VPN,

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.570
that'll hide your IP address,
giving you a bunch of cool features,

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.400
you can now go into your Nora VPN app,

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.150
click on that little shield there and
turn on web and file protection with just

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.650
one click or two clicks
of turning on with that.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:00.820
You're getting malware protection.

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.580
You try to go to malicious websites
and it won't let you do it.

00:03:03.585 --> 00:03:05.260
It protects you from you. Like seriously,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.800
if you try to download an infected
file with file protection that says no,

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.030
don't do that. It's also gonna help out
with blocking trackers, blocking ads.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.790
It's kinda like having ads guard
or pie hole with you all the time.

00:03:15.795 --> 00:03:18.760
And a URL trimmer, essentially
getting rid of your L tracking.

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.460
Now what's cool about threat protection
is that it's on all the time.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.870
Even when you're not connected to vpn,
it's got your back on cyber threats 24 7.

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.050
Now,

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.170
beyond threat protection nor VPN does
something I don't see anyone else doing

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.750
and it's kind of cool. Check this
out. Right now on my network,

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.080
I configured my firewall to block
VPN connections. Check it out.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.070
I'll try to connect to a US vpn and it's
just gonna sit here and try to connect

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.400
because my firewall can recognize
VPN traffic and go, no Uhuh,

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.950
you're not getting through. So I wanna
stop that. It's not gonna happen.

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.060
But no VPN now has obfuscated
&lt;laugh&gt; a very fun word,

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:50.260
servers right here.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.170
Watch what happens when I try to
connect with one of those new servers.

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.160
Click go into Florida, my neck and
connected. Now why did that work?

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.220
Because my firewall couldn't recognize it.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.970
It obfuscated or bewildered &lt;laugh&gt;
my firewall to where it couldn't

00:04:03.975 --> 00:04:07.660
recognize the VPN traffic. Super cool.
Super handy. If you wanna try it,

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.010
check it out. Norv vpn.com/network.
Chuck, I got a link below. Seriously,

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.290
if you don't have a VPN or you
don't like the one you're using,

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.380
or if you do like the one you're using,
switch anyway. &lt;laugh&gt; use nor V vpn,

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.750
support the channel. Check it
out, link below. Seriously,

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.480
thank you to norv VPN for sponsoring
this video and making things like this

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.800
possible. Here we go. Part one, let
me show you just how big Windows is.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.480
Stuff you can't even fathom. But first,
windows a history as fast as possible.

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.310
In fact, can I do it in 60
seconds? Editor? Give me 60
seconds somewhere. Ready?

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.310
Let's go. Windows was born in 1985.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.090
It was a gooey or graphical interface
for Ms. Dos. Couldn't do much.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.170
The most fun was the clock program.
In 1990, something amazing happened.

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.900
My wife was born also Windows 3.0.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.570
This thing was revolutionary
software and file icons.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.860
It looks dumb and slow right now,

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.400
but this was groundbreaking and also
kind of fun. You gotta try this.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.170
I've got a link below. You
can do it for free. &lt;laugh&gt;,

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.880
look at control panel &lt;laugh&gt;. It's
amazing. It gave us virtual memory,

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.880
Minesweeper and solitaire. I was
always terrible at solitaire.

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.660
Not long after that was Windows 3.1,
which gave us Windows Media player.

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.850
This is seriously pretty
fun. You have to try this.

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:17.560
This one I had to build out myself in
virtual box. In 1995, we had Windows 95.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.100
Let's start it up. &lt;laugh&gt;,

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.550
you hear that Windows 95 kind of feels
like home. It gave us our task bar,

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:29.260
our start button. This was
my first computer OS in
1998. We have Windows at 98.

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:30.250
Oh man,

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.150
this brings back the memories and it
seems much like Bill Gates demo of Windows

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.580
98. Mine is failing. Look
at us, me and Bill. You'll.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.460
Notice that this scanner bill, whoa.

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.680
But it gave us improved USB support,
multiple monitors, which is kind of huge.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.550
They were actually really big like the
one behind me back there and it just

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.310
looked prettier. I wish I could look
at it right now. Then things got weird.

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.460
We got Windows Me or Millennium
Edition came out in the year 2000.

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.070
It was terrible, but it did
come with automatic updates,

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.160
restore and Windows movie maker, which
is where I made my first YouTube video.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.980
Fun fact, it was the original
Cinnamon Challenge &lt;laugh&gt;.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.780
And it's the reason I'm doing what I
am doing today. But it wasn't all lost.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.950
Windows 2000 came out in the year
2000. This is actually pretty good.

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.400
It had a server version of the same
name and it brought in Active directory,

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.850
which is what we still use today.
Then we brought out the Big Guns 2001,

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:24.560
my favorite Windows OS of all time
Windows xp. Let's start this Bad boy up.

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.720
Oh my gosh, look at this. Oh,

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.020
people use this OS forever. In fact,

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.420
it was the first OS I
supported on the help desk.

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:38.960
I had to migrate people off of XP to
Windows seven. This thing was amazing.

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:41.390
It was stable, it brought
in remote desktop.

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:44.540
It was a beautiful os mainly
because it had pinball.

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:51.740
I know my timer's out, I don't care,
I'm just gonna play pinball. 2006,

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:54.230
we had Windows Vista and no one
liked it. I thought it was okay.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:56.240
I had a good time. But it
brought in Windows search,

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:00.890
windows Defender and user account
control, all which we use today. 2009,

00:07:00.895 --> 00:07:04.040
brought in Windows seven, the only
good replacement for Windows xp.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.860
It was beautiful, had great
performance security, it was great.

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:09.560
And then we had Windows
eight, which wasn't 2012.

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:11.300
They tried to build it
for touch applications.

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:13.820
Everyone hated and they took away our
start bar. Don't take my start bar,

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.550
but then they brought it back in
Windows 8.1, but we were so burnt by it.

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:18.080
No one &lt;laugh&gt;, no one did it.

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:21.140
They got smart and they released
Windows 10 in 2015, which was amazing.

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:24.230
We just left that version. It brought
us Cortana, which we don't use,

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:27.200
and the edge browser, which is
actually pretty cool now. And finally,

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.380
we're at Windows 11. Windows 11
gave us a better virtual desktop.

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.810
So we can do stuff like this. Let's
how you do it. Hold on. Oh yeah.

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:36.320
This old guy over here, right?
No. Oh, it's this guy &lt;laugh&gt;.

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:39.290
Why couldn't I find that? Yeah, create
a new desktop. Kind of neat. Again,

00:07:39.295 --> 00:07:42.560
I don't use it &lt;laugh&gt; ever. And
we got, you know, widgets I think.

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:44.930
And the apps look different
in our start menu,

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.930
but you can't really call a start menu.
I mainly just do Windows Key. Okay,

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:51.200
I'm I'm rambling. Things look visually
different. They perform better.

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:54.680
That's what we're using now. That was
Windows history in exactly 60 seconds.

00:07:54.685 --> 00:07:59.390
I did it right? Yes, but what if
I told you that's not everything.

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:02.030
There's another world of Windows
that you don't even know about.

00:08:02.035 --> 00:08:04.460
They were released around the
same time of each edition.

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:07.730
They're hiding in the background.
I'm talking about Windows servers.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.200
I'm not gonna go over everything,

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.600
but here's a list of all of
them released over the years,

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:16.160
starting with Windows NT 3.1 in
1993 and now we're at Windows Server

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:20.420
2022. Notice they have a yearly naming
scheme now starting in Windows 2000.

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:22.400
But that's the first big thing I
want you to know about Windows.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:26.750
They probably didn't know there are
servers, windows servers. But why?

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.730
Like what is that for? Because as a user,

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:32.810
you're probably just familiar with
Windows 10, windows 11 using the desktop,

00:08:32.815 --> 00:08:35.720
using the laptop, gaming. What's the
server do? Let's talk about that.

00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:39.980
A server provides services. So like
right now you're watching me on YouTube,

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:44.750
right? This service is being provided
by a web server somewhere. In fact,

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:48.830
everything you visit on the internet
is a server providing you a service.

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:52.550
So when we're talking about Windows
server, what is it providing services to?

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:52.940
Well,

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:56.400
in a company you might be running Windows
Server 2022 in your data center and

00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.450
then deployed out to all your employees
will be Windows 11 on their desktops,

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:01.830
on their laptops or whatever it is.

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:06.120
And the Windows server is doing some
pretty cool stuff like centrally managing

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:09.330
user accounts through a little tool
we like to call active directory.

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:11.250
Active directories huge.

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:13.860
It's a skill you have to learn
and think about what it does.

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:17.910
Instead of an admin having to go to each
machine and creating a user account for

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:21.960
each user, which would be tedious,
time consuming and frankly maddening.

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.540
I'm kind of going crazy just
writing this out multiple times.

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:27.780
Can you imagine actually creating it?
Oh my gosh. Instead of doing that,

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:29.490
I've got a server spun up right here.

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:33.540
You would launch a doc or active director
users and computers and create a new

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:37.800
user, Bernard Hack. Well by
the way, on the help desk,

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:40.800
you'll probably end up doing this a
lot. So if you already know this skill,

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:43.350
if you can say, yeah, I've done that
before. I've got my own lab at home,

00:09:43.355 --> 00:09:45.270
I've got this running,
that's pretty killer.

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:46.470
Let's go to finish creating this user.

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:48.750
And what's crazy is that
user I just created,

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:51.420
he can log in to any of the
computers at my company.

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:53.340
Doesn't matter where he
goes, he tries to log in.

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:56.700
The server running Active directory
will handle the authentication.

00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:00.060
The server will also act as
centralized storage, creating shares,

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:03.390
network shares through the
file and storage service.
Create a new one right now.

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:06.450
This creates a network folder that can
be accessed by anyone given permission

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:11.130
using the SMB protocol, which you'll
learn a lot about if you study Windows.

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:12.990
And then this thing will blow your mind.

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:15.420
Windows servers have a
thing called group policy,

00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:20.040
which allow them to control everything
about all the workstations in the

00:10:20.045 --> 00:10:22.860
company, everything down to
the smallest little thing.

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:24.990
And actually check this out, if
you're running Windows right now,

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:25.860
you can try this.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:30.630
Every Windows computer has what's called
local group policy and you can do crazy

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:33.120
things. Try this, we're gonna
open it up. So hit your start bar,

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.970
search for group policy.

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.400
And you have the option to edit
group policy or you may not,

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:39.263
you may not have permission.

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:43.110
Someone blocked you with group policy and
you can do things like, lemme find it.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:48.030
Preventing access to command prompt.
Enable it apply. Okay, try to launch it.

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:50.850
It's been disabled. I always
hated that when it happened to me.

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:53.430
Or you can disable removable USB drives.

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:56.820
So if someone had a flipper zero and
they were trying to use the bad USB

00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:58.710
function, you try to plug
it into your computer,

00:10:58.715 --> 00:11:00.390
but you would change this setting.

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:05.430
Deny a read access enabled bad
USBs, can't hurt you. Sorry,

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:10.590
I was gonna drop that &lt;laugh&gt;.
Let's put a back tape in his drawer.

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:17.040
Now just take a moment and appreciate how
many things you're able to change here

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:20.520
that aren't just available in the regular
menu like control panel and stuff.

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:23.130
And then think about how
you can do this on a server.

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.770
Just one little change in
group policy on the server.

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:29.730
And you can apply this to computers,
you can apply it to users.

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:32.700
It's insanely powerful, insanely fun.

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:35.130
I used to love deploying
things through group policy.

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:36.900
It's also kind of dangerous.
You gotta be careful.

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:39.240
Don't just go crazy with it If
you have access, and by the way,

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.210
there's nothing stopping you from
setting up your Windows computers in your

00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:44.760
house with a window
server controlling them.

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.370
I actually do that right
now for my daughters.

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:50.070
I control everything they do on
their computers with group policy.

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:54.340
It's awesome and needed. You know
what I mean? If you have or sons,

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:55.480
I mean kids are crazy. No,

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.970
I'm just scratching the
surface on what servers can do.

00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:01.180
It takes an entire course just to talk
about it. An entire certification.

00:12:01.185 --> 00:12:02.200
We'll cover that here in a moment.

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:05.980
But what's crazy is in talking about
the big world of Windows that you don't

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:10.480
know, I haven't even talked I
about the cloud, Microsoft Azure,

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:12.970
Microsoft is all about the cloud.
They're pushing everyone to it.

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:15.100
Now what's the cloud? It's
just someone else's computer.

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:19.390
Instead of having a server here in my
closet here, I do have a server room.

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:20.260
Instead of putting it here,

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.810
I would put it in Microsoft's data
center and they would run it for me.

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:26.260
And everything I've talked about
regarding servers can be done in Microsoft

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:30.010
Azure and kind of at a crazy
scale and it can do a lot more.

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:33.040
I mention active directory. Well
we have Azure Active Directory.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.850
You can deploy virtual machines, which
are Windows machines up in the cloud.

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:38.500
I'll actually show you how
to do that here in a moment.

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:40.990
People run their entire
companies in the cloud.

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:45.700
They even have their users accessing
remote desktops that are running in Azure.

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:48.520
So instead of like logging
into a computer at their desk,

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:51.370
they log into a computer at their
desk that actually is somewhere else.

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:53.830
It doesn't make any sense. It's really
cool, but it's actually, it's amazing.

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:56.710
It does make total sense if you study
it and learn it, which you should.

00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:00.130
The cloud, Microsoft Azure, that's
a skillset that you should learn.

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:02.110
And when you do learn it,
well that's big money.

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:03.640
That's the skill companies will pay for.

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.400
I'll cover how you can learn that here
in a bit. Now speaking of the cloud,

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:09.730
let's talk about how you can get access
to Windows and build your own lab.

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:11.920
And I don't care if you already
have a Windows machine right now.

00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:15.430
I mean you can play with Windows
on your current machine, but I,

00:13:15.435 --> 00:13:18.430
if you're like me, you tend
to play too much and break it.

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:20.920
So if you want to avoid
breaking your own stuff,

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:24.430
it's helpful to build out another Windows
machine that you can feel good about

00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:27.220
breaking and then just destroy it, build
it up again, which you can totally do.

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:30.220
Now to build your own Windows lab,
you do have a number of options.

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:32.890
I'm gonna show you two right now.
One you probably already saw coming.

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:35.350
Build Your lab in Microsoft Azure.

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:38.530
I love this option because it kind
of gives you the best of everything.

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:40.780
Not only are you building
a lab to learn windows,

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:44.680
but in the process of building that
lab, you're learning Microsoft Azure.

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:46.750
That is huge. Are you kidding me?

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:51.040
And anyone can do it and starting
out it'll be completely free.

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:54.340
So to set up a Microsoft Azure account
mean there is one kicker that people are

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:56.860
gonna be like, oh Chuck, you
said it was free. This is stupid.

00:13:56.865 --> 00:13:59.560
Why &lt;laugh&gt; Chill with me here?

00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:03.070
It does require you having a
credit card when you get signed up.

00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:05.740
They do that for a couple reasons.
Well really one main reason.

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:08.800
They wanna make sure you're an actual
person and that's how they verify you're a

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:11.650
person. But they won't charge you
for anything unless you say yes,

00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:13.540
I want to be charged this amount of money.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:17.050
So you'll set up a free tier account
and right off the bat you'll get a $200

00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:19.630
credit for the first 30
days to do a lot of stuff.

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:20.620
And let me give you an example.

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:23.740
So I did go out to Google and
I searched for Microsoft Azure.

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:24.790
You should do this right now.

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:28.420
You'll see here the option to set up a
free account and you can start free with

00:14:28.425 --> 00:14:30.070
the $200 credit as promised.

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:32.290
And they have a lot of services
that are free all the time.

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.990
So if you wanna try this, by all
means do it. And once you have it,

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:36.820
check this out. This
is Bernard Hack Well's,

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:39.220
a free Azure account right
now he's on the free tier.

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:41.500
I have a Windows server
and Windows 11 running.

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:44.320
In fact that server I was showing you
earlier, running in Azure for free,

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.750
that Windows 11 machine
also running in Azure.

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:50.230
I've been running these off and on for
a few days and it's only charged me $3

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:53.960
and 64 cents of my $200 free credit. Now,

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.550
even after your free credit,

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:58.820
running stuff in the cloud can be really
fun as a lab because they only charge

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:01.550
you for what you use. It's
pay as you go. So for example,

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:02.720
using their pricing calculator,

00:15:02.725 --> 00:15:07.070
I'm pricing out a Windows 11 machine with
this particular sizing because it does

00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:09.650
matter how big your machine
is, how much RAM and cpu.

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:12.680
This will cost me about 12 cents
an hour as you can see here.

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:16.160
And it's only gonna charge me that
while it's running. If I shut it down,

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:17.930
I'm not being charged
for it. So imagine this,

00:15:17.935 --> 00:15:20.870
you set up a Windows lab in Azure. Let's
say it's four machines, couple servers,

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:24.170
couple windows, VMs, let's say 12 cents
an hour. And you study for an hour.

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.900
What's that? 48 cents, 50
cents, let's call it 50 cents.

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.640
It costs you 50 cents
that data to your lab.

00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:31.040
I think it's a pretty cool way to
do it. Probably my favorite way.

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:33.830
And I always use Azure when I'm deploying
Windows stuff and playing with it.

00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:35.600
It's my go-to. And while I got you here,

00:15:35.605 --> 00:15:38.540
lemme show you how easy it is to
create a virtual machine in Azure.

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:41.300
So once you do have your account set
up, you might be kinda like, oh Chuck,

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:45.230
where do I go? Cuz it can be kind of a
lot &lt;laugh&gt;. Large companies use this.

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:48.470
Enterprises use this to run their entire
company. But once you're in Azure,

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:51.350
you can click on the little menu icon
on the left and click on create a

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:53.690
resource. You'll search for
what you wanna create for you.

00:15:53.695 --> 00:15:56.840
It might be Windows 11, just hit enter.
And if you're using the free tier,

00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:58.550
you'll want to use the Windows 11 preview,

00:15:58.555 --> 00:16:01.520
which is just an advanced version of
Windows, previewing the newest stuff.

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:04.340
Create that. There's just a few things
you have to change, like the name of it,

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:06.500
if you scroll down a bit, you
can change the size of it.

00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:08.720
This'll change how much
you'll be charged per month.

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:10.790
This one actually is
a pretty good machine.

00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:13.580
Put in your username and and password
one you wanna create right now.

00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:16.880
Check this licensing box. And then
there's one thing I always change,

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:20.330
just really one more thing I'll go
over to uh, I'll scroll to the top.

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:24.620
Click on monitoring. I will under
boot diagnostics, click disable.

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:26.810
And that's pretty much it. We'll
click on review and create.

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:29.870
It's gonna make sure everything's
good to go. Validation has passed.

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:32.120
And then we'll click on create
and just give it a minute.

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:33.080
Take a little coffee break.

00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:35.600
I mean it is building an entire
computer for you in the cloud.

00:16:35.605 --> 00:16:38.750
So give us some time.
Now while that's cooking,

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:41.360
I do wanna show you one thing
to give you some peace of mind.

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:44.330
Many of you may be worried, okay am
I'm gonna be charged a ton of money.

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:47.420
I've heard horror stories about the
cloud making people go bankrupt. No,

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:48.470
that's not gonna happen to you.

00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:49.760
And let me show you how
you can make sure of that.

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:53.120
We're gonna go to the left here, top
left and display all our services stuff.

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:56.360
At the bottom left we have cost management
and billing. Click on that here.

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:58.460
It shows you everything that's going on.

00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:00.920
It'll show you your free credits and
how much stuff you have remaining.

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:04.070
It'll show you what you have to due. So
for now, if you're using the free tier,

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:05.660
you'll have nothing due. And again,

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:10.190
once the free tier is over that 30
days and you do have services still up,

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:13.400
they're not gonna charge you for those
services. They're gonna say, Hey, um,

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:16.730
you still have stuff up. Do you wanna
start a pay as you go subscription?

00:17:16.850 --> 00:17:19.850
And you can say yes or no.
And if you don't do anything,

00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:21.560
they're just gonna shut
it down. No big deal.

00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:24.890
Now let's say you do start
your subscription and you're
worried that you might

00:17:24.895 --> 00:17:27.230
be overcharged or forget a virtual
machine was up or something.

00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:28.490
You can fix that real easy.

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:33.500
You can go to cost alerts over here on
the left and we can add a new budget.

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:38.720
I'll name it, I don't
want to go broke, please.

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:42.380
And we can set a monthly budget,
like maybe it's 20 bucks.

00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:46.250
And when we hit an actual budget of 50%,

00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:47.840
send me an alert to this email.

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:50.040
Now let's go look at our virtual
machine and try to access it real quick.

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:52.560
Let's go to our menu. We'll
go to resource groups.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:55.620
A resource group is kinda like a
folder containing a bunch of resources.

00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:58.200
And when you created a virtual
machine, you created one as well.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:01.140
Here I have my Windows 11 machine
group that was created for me.

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:03.390
And inside that I've got a few resources.

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:06.840
Mainly my Windows 11 machine right
here with a little computer icon.

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:10.230
I click on him, he's launched, ready
to go. If I wanna connect to him,

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:14.340
I got a little connect button up here
at the top left. Click on connect,

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:18.210
we're gonna connect via R dp and then
we'll download the R DP file right here.

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:21.030
Notice that downloaded a file here
on Windows. I'll just click it,

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:22.380
click on connect,

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:24.900
enter the account information I
configured when I first set it up.

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:27.060
And just like that, &lt;laugh&gt;,

00:18:27.065 --> 00:18:30.300
I have a Windows machine in the
cloud that I can log into, mess with,

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:34.590
break destroy whatever anytime I want.
And you can access this from anywhere,

00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:38.100
from any device, even your phone
using remote desktop. It's very easy.

00:18:38.105 --> 00:18:40.200
But if you'd like me to walk you
through it, I've got it in my course.

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:43.050
Now if you wanna stop your virtual
machine and stop being charged for it,

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:45.870
we can go to overview and
simply click on stop. Yep,

00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:48.660
I wanna stop it and it'll stop your
virtual machine. If you wanna delete it,

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:49.493
remove it.

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:53.250
The best way to do that most of the time
is to delete the entire resource group

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:54.450
that the virtual machine is part of.

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:58.050
So if I go back to my resource groups
and click on my 11 machine group,

00:18:58.110 --> 00:18:59.790
I can click on delete resource group.

00:18:59.795 --> 00:19:01.800
It'll ask you to confirm
by typing the name in,

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:06.810
so my Win 11 machine underscore group and

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:10.200
then delete everything in there. Cause
you'd have a network security group,

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:14.400
you've got a firewall group and and
a public ip. No, delete it again.

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:17.850
Here we go. Delete. So it'll clean up
everything for you. Now beyond Azure,

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.710
you can also run everything local,

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:22.560
setting up your own virtual
machines on your own computer.

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:25.410
Now this option is also very, very fun,

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:28.860
but only fun if you have enough
resources. Now what do I mean by that?

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:30.420
Well if you're not familiar
with virtual machines,

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:33.240
first of all go watch my video.
I detail everything about them.

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:35.370
But just know when you're
running a virtual machine,

00:19:35.375 --> 00:19:38.460
you're running another computer on
your computer you have right now.

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:40.920
And much like inviting a
new person to live with you,

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:44.970
you're gonna have to share resources
with that new person or with that new

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:46.830
computer. And my question for you is,

00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:50.430
does your computer right now
have enough resources to spare?

00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:54.510
And what I mean is this, um, if you open
up your task manager here in Windows,

00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:57.720
just go to your search bar, search
for task manager. There it is.

00:19:57.870 --> 00:20:01.780
And you'll see right here we have a
little performance graph icon that we can

00:20:01.785 --> 00:20:02.280
click on.

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:04.710
This will tell you how many resources
your computer is using right now.

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:07.920
The main concern for virtual machines
will be memory and the amount of disc

00:20:07.925 --> 00:20:10.080
space you have. CPU is
definitely a concern,

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:12.870
but for most machines it's going
to not really be a problem.

00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:13.763
Memory is a big one.

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:18.690
Now if you can see from mine right now
I have 64 gigs of memory and I'm only

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:21.720
using 50% and that's running
all my stuff right now.

00:20:21.725 --> 00:20:25.380
So I know I could probably create four
or 5, 6, 7 virtual machines cause I have

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:27.810
so much memory available to spare.

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:30.570
If you're rocking a four gigabyte
memory laptop or something,

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:33.240
you're in trouble buddy. I wouldn't
do anything with virtual machines.

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:35.610
But if you have eight to 16,
you can probably run a few.

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:38.370
And what that's gonna look like
is downloading a hypervisor,

00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:43.410
a free one called Virtual Box and
then downloading a Windows 11 ISO or

00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:45.450
Windows Server 2022.

00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:49.330
You can get a free trial version
and download any of these for free.

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:51.640
Let me walk you through that
real quick. It's not too crazy.

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:54.550
You can go to Google and simply
search for download Windows 11.

00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:56.620
That'd be the first link in the search.

00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:01.510
And you can just download an ISO
for SI x 64 devices download now

00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:04.330
choose your language and then
simply click on download.

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:06.190
Now I do wanna caution
you with this &lt;laugh&gt;.

00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:11.290
You do wanna make sure that
you have an X 86 X 64 system.

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:14.830
Most people do, unless you're running
the new MacBooks like M one, M two,

00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:17.080
apple silicon, this is
not gonna work for that.

00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:19.360
The new MacBooks are
built with arm processors,

00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:23.530
meaning you'll need an arm-based os. Now
Windows 11 does have an ARM-based os,

00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:27.340
but it's kind of difficult to get access
and find a good ISO to to use with

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:30.310
virtual box. But there is a really
easy way to do that with Parallels.

00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:34.000
Parallels is a hypervisor similar
to Virtual Box but it's not free.

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:37.450
But they make it super easy to download
Windows 11. So if you wanna try it out,

00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:40.540
they do a free trout for 14 days and
the first thing they ask you to do is

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:43.810
install Windows 11, which they
make it just, it's so stupid easy.

00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:46.030
I don't know why it's so
hard for everyone else.

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:49.660
But once you have your Windows 11 iso,
you'll want to go download Virtual Box.

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:52.180
You'll just search for
virtual box and my Google,

00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:54.640
click on that first link and
download it for whatever I'm using.

00:21:54.645 --> 00:21:57.130
If you have an Intel based Mac,
it'll probably work for you.

00:21:57.430 --> 00:22:01.120
Windows host Linux distributions that got
your back download and install that to

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:01.960
basic installation.

00:22:01.965 --> 00:22:05.500
If you run into any issues specific to
virtual machines and working with Virtual

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:07.180
Box, check out my virtual machine video.

00:22:07.185 --> 00:22:10.840
I do demo and detail a few things that
might be a bit of a stumbling block for

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:12.790
you. But once you have
virtual box up and running,

00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:16.600
you simply click on new type in
what you wanna build. Windows 11,

00:22:16.605 --> 00:22:19.300
that's what I wanna name it.
Type in machine, select your iso,

00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:22.930
I would skip the unattended
installation. Click on next Notice.

00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:24.850
It does default to four gigs of memory.

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:28.900
That's the minimum required for Windows
11, two virtual CPUs. That's fine,

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:32.020
you can increase it if you
want 80 gigabytes of storage,

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:35.890
it's not gonna pre allocate the
entire thing Next, next finish.

00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:39.580
And all you gotta do is start that sucker
up and install Windows 11 like it's a

00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:42.880
brand new laptop. It's kind of cool.
And you do have to hit the key to say,

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:46.330
I want a boot from the cd. I made that
mistake earlier, I forgot to do it.

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:50.470
And that process works for any server
OS you wanna go with unless you're using

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:52.750
Mac uh, in one processors.

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:55.930
Cause you can get a free trial of
any server OS right now for Windows.

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:59.740
It's pretty amazing. Now, how can you
learn Windows in a structured way?

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:02.620
I'm a big fan of this now you
can play with Windows all day,

00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:03.790
but if you wanna get serious,

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:06.280
you'll want some kind of course
or structured learning plan,

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:09.220
like a certification to take you deeper
in the things that you wouldn't even

00:23:09.225 --> 00:23:11.950
think about learning. There are two
options I wanna cover right now.

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:15.160
Certifications and courses. Let's
start with certifications. Now,

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:16.390
you know I love certifications.

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:19.390
The first one I would recommend
is the CompTIA A plus.

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.210
Now there's good and bad with
this. The good is that, man,

00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:25.960
it covers so much in the certification.
If you want to become an IT person,

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:28.300
if you wanna get started on the
help desk, get your first job in it.

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:30.670
The A plus is a great start.
It was my certification,

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:35.860
but it covers everything
from USBs to tablets to some

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:36.790
Linux stuff.

00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:40.060
It'll have a section on Windows os and
the basics of what you need to know.

00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:42.070
It won't cover everything Windows.

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:44.740
So even some of the stuff we covered in
this video they're not gonna talk about.

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:46.190
That's gonna be very basic.

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:49.580
But it is a great starting point and it
will look pretty good on your resume.

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:53.060
It'll help you get a job. Now the other
option is going Microsoft specific.

00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:54.650
Microsoft does have certifications.

00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:58.130
Let's go to Microsoft's certification
place and we'll talk about it. Now,

00:23:58.130 --> 00:24:01.910
I do love Microsoft certifications, like
you'll learn a ton going through them.

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:05.330
My only beef with them is
that they change so much.

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:07.730
And here's the problem with that.
When you're getting a certification,

00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:10.850
one of the main considerations that
you want something that's marketable,

00:24:10.855 --> 00:24:14.390
so think ccna, compt A plus.
If you put that on your resume,

00:24:14.395 --> 00:24:17.780
you know when an HR person or a
hiring manager sees that they,

00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:19.880
they know what it is and
they know what, you know,

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.560
Microsoft kind of struggles with that.

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:24.710
They used to have what's called the
MCs A, which is very recognized.

00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:27.500
It was like similar to the ccna,
but then they did away with it.

00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:29.180
And I don't even know, like &lt;laugh&gt;,

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:32.270
I couldn't tell you off the top of my
head what the certifications are apart

00:24:32.275 --> 00:24:35.090
from the Azure ones, which are marketable.
So let's talk about that right now.

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:38.900
First, let's go Windows specific.
A brand new one that I really like,

00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:43.040
if you wanna learn Windows and Windows
desktop at a deeper level is the MD

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:47.330
1 0 2, the Microsoft 365 certified
modern desktop administrator associate.

00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:51.740
And I say modern because you're gonna
be learning about it from the 365 view,

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:54.170
which is like their cloud
version of how to manage stuff.

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:57.230
I'm not gonna go deep into that now,
but it does include Microsoft 365,

00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:58.063
some Azure,

00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:02.420
but also a lot of managing and deploying
and fixing and supporting Microsoft

00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:03.530
Windows. Now again,

00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:07.670
I don't see a lot of people asking
specifically for this because no one knows

00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:10.760
about it. You're gonna be doing
this one for the knowledge,

00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:13.160
and if a hiring manager
does happen to look at you,

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:15.830
they like you and they ask you, Hey, what
is this thing? You can tell them, Hey,

00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:19.220
latest and greatest, I know my
stuff. Then they'll go, oh, okay.

00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:22.820
But it's getting past that initial HR
screen that this might give you a problem

00:25:22.825 --> 00:25:26.270
with. Now beyond this one, they have
the Microsoft certified Windows server,

00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:29.270
hybrid administrator associate,
a mouthful and a half.

00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:32.810
This one's more server focused.
I would recommend if you, man,

00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:34.190
you're going hog wild with windows,

00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:37.730
go to the MD 1 0 2 first and
then jump and see this guy.

00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:40.580
Looks like it does take two exams
to get land the certification,

00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:42.590
the AZ eight hundred and eight oh one,

00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:47.060
and they say hybrid because
they're talking about
on-prem and a data center and

00:25:47.065 --> 00:25:49.040
also in the cloud. Microsoft Azure.

00:25:49.045 --> 00:25:51.560
A lot of companies are living in
both worlds right now, hybrid.

00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:53.600
And then if you wanna go full on cloud,

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:56.180
which I've gotten both of
these certifications, I'm
about to recommend to you.

00:25:56.270 --> 00:25:57.890
And I actually taught
courses on 'EM as well.

00:25:58.010 --> 00:26:02.300
These certifications are fantastic. We
have the beginner version, the AZ 900,

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:05.780
Microsoft certified Azure Fundamentals.
If you're new to Cloud, perfect.

00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:08.930
If you're not new to cloud,
jump straight into the AZ 1 0 4,

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:11.750
Azure Administrator Associate Landing.

00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:14.870
These two certifications
makes you crazy valuable.

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:19.700
If you want to get started at Nit
Man, having this will be solid.

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:20.515
I have to say this,

00:26:20.515 --> 00:26:23.600
it will help to know a bit of Windows
before you start these because these are

00:26:23.605 --> 00:26:28.280
very cloud focused. They're focusing
on deploying stuff and Microsoft Azure,

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:32.870
but they're assuming you already
know how to deploy Windows and what

00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:33.920
servers are like.

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:36.890
They're assuming a lot and
they're assuming you can
take that knowledge and then

00:26:36.895 --> 00:26:39.200
learn how to deploy that in the
cloud. So as a prerequisite,

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:42.770
I would say learn Windows, and that
was from the certification perspective,

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:46.410
but I don't necessarily think you
need a certification to learn windows.

00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:48.870
Learning windows can be done in a course.

00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:51.930
A course that gives you enough to
move on to the more advanced things.

00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:53.100
That's part of the reason right now.

00:26:53.105 --> 00:26:55.770
I have a Windows Fundamentals
course on my academy.

00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:58.740
It is currently in development and it'll
probably be finished by the time you

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:01.890
see this, and you can look at it link
below right now. But in that course,

00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:06.300
I give you enough to be dangerous with
windows and enough to step forward to the

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:08.280
next things and not feel
like a fish outta water.

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:11.400
So you could step forward into
the Azure world and not feel like,

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:13.560
I don't know windows. You know,
you'll have enough skills.

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:14.820
Or if you wanna become a hacker,

00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:18.390
you can learn enough windows
in this course to move
forward and be dangerous and

00:27:18.395 --> 00:27:20.490
start learning more advanced
things. It's fundamentals,

00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:21.900
it's giving you a good foundation.

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:25.800
Other courses I love are
on Hack the Box Academy.

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:30.060
They have a Windows Fundamentals course
that is mostly actually all text-based,

00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:32.220
so if you enjoy reading,
you'll have a good time.

00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:36.210
And they do have labs built into it,
which is a really, honestly pretty killer.

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:37.890
That's all I got. I'll
catch you guys next time.
