WEBVTT
Kind: captions
Language: en

00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.380
A web browser that runs inside the
terminal. Why do we even need this?

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:07.590
I don't know, but I want it. I
want to try it right now. Honestly,

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.680
it sounds kind of awesome. I don't have
to leave my terminal. I'm already there.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.430
It'll block ads by default because it
legit can't load them. I'm intrigued.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.040
How do you scroll and
how do you click links?

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.680
I'm kind of excited to try that
and yeah, I haven't set this up.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.470
So we're setting this up together.
You and me. Get your copy ready.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.640
This is five minute Friday.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.660
It's called links and the
website is kind of 1995.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.800
It's probably easy to browse with their
browser. I get it. Oh wait, hold on.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.040
They have a version for Windows too.
Okay, we're going to try that too.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.040
But first we'll do Linux
seems pretty basic. On Debian,

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.100
you're using a PT and then DNF
of Fedora and Pacman on Arch.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.570
So I'm going to try this in Ubuntu on
WSL. So curious about how this works.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.980
So we'll do a pseudo A PT install
links. Do a dash y at the end,

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.090
pseudo password. Let's
go. Okay, that was it.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.320
Now what I have no idea what to do,
maybe I just type in links. I'm using it.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.590
It's a fully featured worldwide web
browser. They do have a user guide.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.140
I'm going to try and do
this without the user guide.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.670
So we use the up and down arrow keys
to move, right to follow a link. Okay.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.120
And left to go back. That seems pretty
simple. I can get down with that. Okay,

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.050
so I guess, hold on. What do I do?
Okay, I think I'm at the main screen.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.650
I'm going to hit Oh, for options. What
are my options here? You can do vi mode.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.280
This a little too much for me.
Let's make my browser bigger here.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.500
I'm going to exit. Start it again.
I just closed out of my Ubuntu.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.740
Okay, let's try it again. Oh, it was
made by the University of Kansas.

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.320
That's pretty cool. Let's do
question mark. I don't know,

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.570
that's just searching stuff.
Okay, we're on the main screen.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.620
If I type in G to go somewhere,
oh, there we go. So type in G.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.525
I'll go to network chuck.com.
Now my site is very,

00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:51.930
very graphic heavy. It's going,

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.020
oh my gosh, that's cool. Alright,
so I'm just going to scroll down to,

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.770
let's go to about the right arrow.
Yeah, it went to the About me page,

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.170
which I need to update. It's
only got 2.8 million subscribers.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.180
I've got a lot more.
Alright, go to academy.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.690
Now it's saying do I want to accept a
cookie? I'm just going to put it always,

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:11.880
man, this is so cool.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.680
I would not recommend going to academy
dot number chuck.com with this because

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.500
it's the video course website. So
I think I've got the gist of this.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.330
Now how do I click on G again? Okay,
so G will get you to another url.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.160
Let's try going to info dot
aci learning.com/network.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.993
Chuck,

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.400
that's just a really terrible segue to
our sponsor ACI learning the provider of

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.190
IT pro. Okay, so this is
pretty cool. Now real quick,

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.360
you do save 30% off your first
month or year with code Chuck 30.

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.080
Now what is it Pro? If you want to get
started in it and learn things like, hey,

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.890
what's a computer?

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.430
All the way up to Linux and
PowerShell on the cloud and hacking.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.200
You can do all that with IT Pro.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.630
You could start an entirely
new career with IT pro.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.610
They've got videos that
won't bore you to tears.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.150
We're going to try and get logged in.
Browsing this in a terminal is not easy.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.200
I love the description of the
what, the fill in texts for photos,

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.960
happy man in suit using
laptop. That could be you.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.040
I just want to get logged in platform
logins, choose my path ACI on demand,

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.430
and that's where it dies because
as we'll talk about later,

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.180
it doesn't load things really well when
you have to use JavaScript and login

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.540
forms or anything fancy. But seriously,
here's it pro the real website,

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.480
much prettier. And again, they've got
everything you need to get started.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.040
Entry level, it gets your A plus to
network plus security, plus CTNA.

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.940
All the cloud certs. You have pretty
much all of them. AWS certifications.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.220
They've got practice tests and
they've got virtual elapse.

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.880
Pretty much everything you need to get
started in it and prepare for practice

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.180
exams. So again, check it out,
link below. Use a regular browser,

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.640
not a terminal one for obvious reasons.

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.970
And don't forget to use Chuck 30 for
30% off your first month or year.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.450
Let's try. What would be a good
website? Go to bleeping computer.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.630
I got to admit that you accepting
the cookie thing every time is really

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.520
annoying. This news
article is kind of crazy.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.520
National public data confirms breach
exposing social security numbers.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.340
Let's go right Key to
that. One more cookies.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.210
Is there a way to always accept cookies?
Oh wait, am I saving a document?

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.900
Cancel. This is so fun. Oh,
I keep trying to go back

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.060
and then I quit. Okay, that was so fun.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.580
Now I'm going to jump back in there
and see if I can just enable, oh,

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:23.560
I feel so out of my element with this.

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.970
I'm going to go to options to see if I
can always accept cookies. Accept all.

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.000
Okay, perfect. That'll make this
so much better. And then, okay,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.410
so how do I get out and save? Oh, it's
right here. Oh, shoot. Accept changes.

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:37.630
There we go. You got to be
careful. You go to that left arrow,

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:38.440
you're going to go back.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.620
Now they have a whole user
guide of how to download stuff,

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.130
navigating special links like
mail tool links and comments.

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.970
So kind of love this.

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.270
But a couple of things because
this is a text-based only browser.

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.470
You can't go to certain sites like
YouTube and enjoy YouTube. Actually,

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.320
I'm curious what happens when I
go to YouTube? We have to try it.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.130
Let's go to YouTube.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.510
Can I just type in A URL like this
links and then I'll do youtube.com?

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.850
Yes, it does it. I thought
I told you. Oh, GPSI.

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:11.530
That's cool. Okay, sure.
Yes. Accept all the cookies.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.220
Yeah, it hates this. So YouTube
isn't going to work great.

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:20.710
And any site that requires any kind
of JavaScript or special scripts to

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.250
allow you to log in like Gmail, it's
not going to do great with, but still,

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:25.083
it's pretty fun.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.790
Let me know how you're going to use
this or if you'll ever use this.

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.370
If anything, it's just fun to
try. Oh, and we forgot one thing.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.510
Can we install it on Windows? I don't
know why I'd want to because I've got WSL,

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:36.610
but I'm curious. No, I'm
not going to mess with this.

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.120
It's talking about Windows seven. I'm
not doing that. That's too old for me.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.040
I'll stick with Linux. Anyways,

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.670
that's a five minute Friday fun little
tool I found that could be fun for you.

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:49.300
I'm not sure. I'll probably end up using
it every once in a while. That's it.

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:50.440
I'll catch you guys next time.
