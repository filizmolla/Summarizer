00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.150
I built an AI server for my daughters.
Well, first it was more for me.

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:04.980
I wanted to run all of my AI locally.

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:09.060
And I'm not just talking command line
with alama. No, no, no. We have a gui,

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.180
a beautiful chat interface and
this thing's feature filled.

00:00:12.185 --> 00:00:15.030
It's got our back chat
histories, multiple models,

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:16.560
we can even add stable diffusion.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.800
And I was able to add this to my notes
application obsidian and have my chat

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.870
interface right there. I'm going
to show you how to do this.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.380
Now you don't need something crazy like
Terry, that's what I named my AI server.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.110
It can be something as
simple as this, this laptop,

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.030
I'll actually demo the
entire setup on this laptop.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.790
So likely the computer you're using
right now, the one you're watching,

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.640
this video one will probably work. And
seriously, you're going to love this.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.480
It's customizable, it's wicked fast,
way faster than anything else I've used.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.650
Isn't that amazing? And again, it's
local, it's private. I control it,

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.900
which is important because I'm
getting it to my daughters.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.360
I want them to be able to
use AI to help with school,

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.880
but I don't want them to cheat
or do anything else weird.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.110
But because I have control,

00:00:52.115 --> 00:00:55.740
I can put in special model files that
restrict what they can do, they can ask,

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.110
and I'll show you how to do that. So
here we go. Get your coffee ready.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.930
We're about to dive in, but
first let me have you meet Terry.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.140
Now Terry has a lot of muscle. So
for the case, I needed something big.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.170
I got the Leon Lee zero 11 dynamic EVO xl.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.060
It's a full tower EATX case perfect
to hold my ASUS X six 70 E Creator pro

00:01:12.065 --> 00:01:14.100
art motherboard. This
thing's also a beast.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.840
I'll put it in the description
so you can look at it. Now,

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.250
I also gave Terry a big brain.
He's got the A MD Ryzen 9 79 50 x.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.570
That's 4.2 gigahertz and 16 cores.
From memory, I went a little crazy.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.890
I've got 128 gigabytes of
the gki trite D five Neo,

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.160
it's DDR R five 6,000 and way
overkill for what I'm doing.

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.100
I think I got a Leon Lee
water cooler for the CPU.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.470
I'm not sure if I'm seeing
Leon Lee, right? I don't know.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.500
Correct me in the comments. You always
do. And then for the stuff AI loves,

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.240
I got two 40 nineties,

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.720
it's the MSI Sremm and their liquid cooled
so they could fit on my motherboard.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.610
24 gigabytes of memory each giving me
plenty of muscle For my AI models for

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.730
storage, we got two Samsung
nine 90 pros, two terabytes,

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.620
which you can't see because
they're behind stuff.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.540
And also of Corsair AX 1600 I power supply
1600 watts to power the entire build.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.490
Terry is ready. Now,

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.280
I'm surprised to say my system
actually posted on the first attempt,

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.120
which is amazing.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.970
But what's not amazing is the fact
that Ubuntu would not install.

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.110
I tried for hours actually for a whole
day and I almost gave up and installed

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.570
Windows, but I said, no,
Chuck, you're installing Linux.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.910
So I tried something new, something
I've never messed with before.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.720
It's called Pop Os by system
76. This thing is awesome.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.280
It worked the first time.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.920
It even had a special image
with Nvidia drivers built in.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.350
It just stink and worked.
So I sipped some coffee,

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.210
didn't question the magic and moved on.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.180
Now if you do want to build something
similar, I've got all the links below.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.280
But anyways, let's talk about how to
build your very own local AI server.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.420
First, what do you need? Really all
you'll need is a computer. That's it.

00:02:42.425 --> 00:02:46.350
It can be any computer running Windows,
Mac or Linux. And if you have a GPU,

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.470
you'll have a much better time. Now,
again, I have to emphasize this,

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.030
you won't need something
as beefy as Terry,

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.790
but the more powerful your computer
is, the better time you'll have.

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.170
Don't come at me with a Chromebook
please. Now step one, alama.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.660
This is the foundation for all of our
AI stuff and what we'll use to run AI

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:02.290
models.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.270
So we'll head on over to alama.ai and
click on download and they've get a flavor

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.970
for every os. I love that.
Now if you're on Mac,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.070
just download it right now and
run it. If you're on Windows,

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.970
they do have a preview version, but
I don't want you to do that. Instead,

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.180
I want you to try the Linux version.
We can install it with one command.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.980
And yes, you can run Linux on Windows
with WSL. Let's get that going real quick.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.120
First thing I'll do is go to the start
bar and search for terminal and launch my

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.780
terminal.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.960
Now those first bit is for Windows
folks only Linux people to hang on for a

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.740
moment, we got to get WSL installed
or the Windows subsystem for Linux.

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.720
It's only one command WSL
dash install and that's it.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.080
Actually hit enter and that's going to
start doing some stuff. When it's done,

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.620
we'll set up a username and password.
I got a new keyboard by the way.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.940
Do you hear that link below? It's my
favorite keyboard of the entire world.

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.010
Now some of you may have
to reboot. That's fine.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.440
Just pause the video and come
back. Mine is ready to go though.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.290
And we're walking Ubuntu 22.04,

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.200
which is still amazing to me that
we're running Linux on Windows.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.100
That's just magic right now we're about
to install Llama, but before we do that,

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.850
you got to do some best practice
stuff like updating our packages.

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.500
So we'll do a pseudo a PT update
and then we'll do a pseudo A PT

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:20.320
upgrade Y to apply all those updates.

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:21.670
And actually while it's updating,

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:25.240
can I tell you something about our
sponsor IT Pro by a CI Learning.

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.270
Now in this video, we're going to
be doing lots of heavy Linux things.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.200
I'm going to walk you through it.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.230
I'm going to hold your hand and you may
not really understand what's happening.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:33.820
That's where IT pro comes in.

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.960
If you want to learn Linux or really
anything in it, they are your go-to,

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.520
that's what I use to learn new stuff.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.370
So if you want to learn Linux to get
better at this stuff or you want to start

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.460
making this whole hobby thing your
career, actually learn some skills,

00:04:45.465 --> 00:04:47.950
get some certifications, get
your A plus, get your CNA,

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.360
get your AWS certifications,

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.440
your Azure certifications and go down
this crazy IT path, which is incredible.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.080
It's the whole reason I make this
channel and make these videos.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.170
Check out IT Pro they've got IT
training that won't put you to sleep.

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:01.330
They have labs, they have practice exams,

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.810
and if you use my Code network check
right now, you'll get 30% off forever.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.750
So go learn some Linux and thank you
to IT Pro for sponsoring this video and

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.600
making things like this possible.
And speaking of my updates are done.

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.330
And by the way, I will have a guide
for this entire thing. Every step,

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.900
all the commands, you can find it at the
Free network Chuck Academy membership.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.270
Click the link below to join and
get some other cool stuff as well.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.180
I can't wait to see you there. Now we
can install llama with one command.

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.100
And again, all commands are below.

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.770
It's going to paste this in
a nice little curl command,

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.350
little magic stuff and
I love how easy this is.

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.540
Watch you just sit
there and let it happen.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.330
Do you not feel like a wizard when
you're installing stuff like this and the

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.610
fact that you're installing
AI right now? Come on.

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.050
I noticed one thing real quick.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.610
Old LAMA did automatically find out
that I have an Nvidia GPU and it's like

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:44.230
awesome, you're going
to have a great time.

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.270
If it didn't see that
and you do have a GPU,

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.610
you may have to install
some Nvidia Cuda drivers.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.130
I'll put a link for that below, but
not everyone will have to do that.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.620
And if you're rocking a Mac
with an M1 through M three chip,

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.860
you're going to have a good time too.
They'll use the embedded GPU Now at this,

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.560
our Mac users, our Linux users and
our Windows users are all converged.

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.310
We're on the same path. Welcome.
We can hold hands and sing.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:06.470
That's getting weird. Anyways,

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:08.900
first we have to test a few things
to make sure alama is working.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.570
And for that we're going to open our
web browser. I know it's kind of weird,

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.140
just stick with me. I'm going to launch
Chrome here and here are my address bar.

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:18.770
I want to type in local host, which
is looking right here at my computer.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.820
And port 1, 1 4, 3, 4, hit enter.

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:24.950
And if you see this
right here, this message,

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.990
you're good to go and you're
about to find this out.

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:32.210
Port 1 1 4 3 4 is what llama's
API services is running
on and it's how our other

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.240
stuff is going to interact with it.
It's so powerful. Just check this out.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.880
I'm so excited to show you
this. Now before we move on,

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.980
let's go ahead and add
an AI model to alama.

00:06:40.185 --> 00:06:45.020
And we can do that right now with alama
Pull and we'll pull down Llama two,

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.190
A very popular one. Hit enter and it's
ready. Now let's test it out real quick.

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:51.950
We'll do Alama run Llama two.

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.460
And if this is your first time
doing this, this is kind of magic.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.390
We're about to interact with a
chat GPT, like AI right here,

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:03.350
no internet required. It's all just
happening in that five gigabyte file.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:08.060
Tell me about the solar eclipse. Boom.

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:11.270
And you can actually control see that
to stop it. Now I want to show you this.

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:12.290
I'm going to open up a new window.

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:14.990
This is actually an awesome
command and with this WSL command,

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:17.570
I'm just connecting to the same
incident. Again, a new window.

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:21.350
I'm going to type in watch dash N 0.5,

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:25.010
not four five Nvidia dash smmi.

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:29.630
This is going to watch the performance
of my GPU right here in the terminal and

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:33.440
keep refreshing it. So keep
an eye on this right here.

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:36.080
As I chat with llama two,

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:40.880
give me a list of all Adam Sandler

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:46.010
movies and look at that GPU Go. Ah,

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:48.860
it's so fun. Now can I show you
what Terry does? Real quick?

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:51.710
I got to show you Terry.
Terry has two GPUs here.

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:55.940
They're right here and Alama can actually
use both of them at the same time.

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.040
Check this out. It's so cool.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:03.530
All the semi old Jackson
movies. And look at that.

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:07.340
Isn't that amazing? And look how
fast it went. That's ridiculous.

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:09.710
This is just the beginning. So
anyways, I had to show you Terry.

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:12.020
So now we have a llama
installed. That's just our base.

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:16.100
Remember I'm going to say bye.
So slash bye to end that session.

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:19.580
Step two is all about the web
ui. And this thing is amazing.

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:23.390
It's called Open Web ui and it's actually
one of many web UI you can get for

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.940
Llama, but I think Open
Web UI is the best.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.820
Now Open Web UI will be run
inside a Docker container.

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:31.250
So you will need Docker installed
and we'll do that right now.

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:34.190
So we'll just copy and paste the
commands from Network Struck Academy.

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:36.800
This is also available
on Docker's website.

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:41.030
First step is updating our repositories
and getting docker's GPG key.

00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:45.230
And then with one command we will install
Docker and all its goodies. Ready,

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:49.940
set, go. Yes, let's do it.
And now with Docker install,

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:52.400
we'll use it to deploy
our open web UI container.

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:55.200
It'll be one command you
can simply copy and paste.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:59.490
This Docker Run Command is going to pull
this image to run this container from

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:03.390
Open Web ui. It's looking at your
local computer for the llama base,

00:09:03.395 --> 00:09:07.500
URL because it's going to integrate and
use Llama and it's going to be using the

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.050
host network adapter to
make things nice and easy.

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:14.010
Keeping in mind this will use Port 80
80 on whatever system you are using.

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:15.390
And all we have to do is hit enter

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:19.770
after we add some pseudo at the beginning,

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:24.090
pseudo docker run and let it do its
thing. Let's verify it real quick.

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:29.100
We'll do a little pseudo docker PS.
We can see that it is indeed running.

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:32.700
And now let's go log in.
It's kind of exciting. Okay,

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:36.180
let's go to our web browser and
we'll simply type in local host

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:41.970
colon port 80, 80, and whoa,
okay, it's really zoomed in.

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:45.000
I'm not sure why yours shouldn't do
that. Now for the first time you run it,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.150
you'll want to click on sign up right
here at the bottom and just put your stuff

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:52.110
in. This login info is only
pertinent to this instance,

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:56.220
this local instance, we'll create
the account and we're logged in.

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:56.855
Now just so you know,

00:09:56.855 --> 00:10:00.690
the first account you log in with or
sign up with will automatically become an

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:04.050
admin account. So right now, you
as a first time user logging in,

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:08.730
you get the power. But look at this.
How amazing is this? Let's play with it.

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:10.530
So the first thing we have
to do is select the model.

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:14.100
I'll click that drop down and we
should have one llama two. Awesome.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.470
And that's how we know also
our connection is working.

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:17.760
I'll go ahead and select
that. And by the way,

00:10:17.765 --> 00:10:20.880
another way to check your connection is
by going to your little icon down here

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:24.330
at the bottom left and clicking
on settings and then connections.

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:26.850
And you can see our oh LAMA
based CRL is right here.

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:30.000
If you ever have to change
that for whatever reason.
Now with LAMA two selected,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.320
we can just start chatting
and just like that,

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:35.640
we have our own little chat,

00:10:35.645 --> 00:10:40.260
GBT that's completely local and
this sucker is beautiful and

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.590
extremely powerful. Now, first
things we can download more models.

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:45.810
We can go out to llama and
see what they have available.

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:50.340
Look on their models to see their list
of models. Code Gemma is a big one.

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:52.830
Let's try that. So to add
code Gemma, our second model,

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:57.810
we'll go back to our command line here
and type in Alama pull code Gemma.

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:01.350
Cool, it's done. Once that's pulled,

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:04.770
we can go up here and just change our
model by clicking on the little dropdown

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:07.890
icon at the top. Yep, there's
code gma. We can switch.

00:11:07.895 --> 00:11:08.970
And actually I've never done this before,

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:11.160
so I have no idea what's going to happen.

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:13.800
I want to click on my
original model LAMA two.

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:18.210
You can actually add another model to
this conversation. Now we have two here.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.560
What's going to happen?

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:25.830
So code Gemma is answering it first.
I'm actually not sure what that does.

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:28.770
Maybe you guys can try it out and
tell me. I want to move on though.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.780
Now some of the crazy stuff
you can see right here,

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.750
it's almost more featured
than chat GBT In some ways.

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:37.260
You got a bunch of options for
editing your responses, copying,

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:39.000
liking and disliking it to help it learn.

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:41.880
You can also have it read things
out to you, continue response,

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:45.390
regenerate response, or even just
add stuff with your own voice.

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:48.630
I can also go down here and this is crazy.

00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:53.980
I can mention another model and it's
going to respond to this and think about

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:57.820
it. Did you see that? I
just had my other model.

00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:00.400
Talk to my current.
That's just weird, right?

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:04.150
Let's try to make 'em have a conversation.
They're going to have a conversation.

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:05.350
What are they going to talk about?

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:10.210
Let's bring back in LAMA two to ask
the question. This is hilarious.

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:13.510
I love this so much. Okay, anyways,
I can spend all day doing this.

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:17.620
We can also with this plus sign upload
files. This includes a lot of things.

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:20.230
Let's try, do I have any documents here?

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:22.540
I'll just copy and paste
the contents of an article,

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:26.770
save that and that'll be
our file. Summarize this.

00:12:27.385 --> 00:12:31.630
You can see our GPU being used over here.
I love that so much. Running locally.

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:35.620
Cool. We can also add pictures
for multimodal models.

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:38.320
I'm not sure coma can do that.
Let's try it out real quick.

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:43.090
So alama can't do it, but there
is a multimodal model called lava.

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:47.200
Let's pull that down real quick with lava
pulled, let's go to our browser here.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:51.550
Once more, we'll refresh it, change
our model to lava. Add the image.

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:57.520
That's really scary. There we go. That's
pretty cool. Now here in a moment,

00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:01.150
I will show you how we can generate
images right here in this web interface by

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:03.760
using stable diffusion. But first
let's play around a bit more.

00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:06.760
And actually the first place I want
to go to is the admin panel For you,

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:10.360
the admin, we have one user and
if we click on the top right,

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:13.780
we have admin settings. Here's
where a ton of power comes in first.

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:16.930
We can restrict people from signing up.
We can say enabled or disabled. Now,

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:18.820
right now, by default it's
enabled. That's perfect.

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:20.590
And when they try to sign up initially,

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:23.770
there'll be a pending user until
you're approved, lemme show you.

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:25.030
So now real quick,

00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:28.990
if you want to have someone else use
this server on your laptop or computer or

00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:29.823
whatever it is,

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:32.710
they can access it from anywhere as
long as they have your IP address.

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:34.750
So lemme do a new user signup
real quick just to show you.

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:39.010
I'll open an incognito window, create
account, and look. It's saying, Hey,

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:41.080
you got to wait. Your
guy has to approve you.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:44.680
And if we go here and refresh our page
on the dashboard, there is Bernard hack.

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:48.460
Well, we can say, you know what? He's a
user or click it again, he's an admin.

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:52.390
No, no he's not. He's going to be a
user. And if we check again, boom,

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:53.290
we have access.

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:57.250
Now what's really cool is if I go
to admin settings and I go to users,

00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:00.820
I can say, Hey, you know what? Don't
allow Chad deletion, which is good.

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:04.210
If I'm trying to monitor what my daughters
are kind of up to on their chats,

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.610
I can also whitelist
models. So you know what,

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:09.430
they're only allowed to
use LAMA two and that's it.

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:12.430
So when I get back to Bernard
hack Well's session over here,

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:14.740
I should only have access to LAMA two.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:18.310
It's pretty sick and it becomes even
better when you can make your own models

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:19.180
that are restricted.

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:23.050
We're going to mo you on over to the
section called model files right up here.

00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:25.480
And we'll click on create a model file.

00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:28.000
You can also go to the community
and see what people have created.

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:31.120
That's pretty cool. I'm going to show you
what I've done for my daughter, Chloe,

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.700
to prevent her from cheating.
She named her assistant Deborah.

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.130
And here's the content. I'm
going to paste it in right now.

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:39.370
The main thing is up here where it
says from, and you choose your model.

00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:42.130
So from llama two. And then
you have your system prompt,

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:45.100
which is going to be
between three double quotes.

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:47.770
And I've got all this telling
it what a can and can't do,

00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:51.410
what Chloe's allowed to ask. And it
ends down here with three double quotes.

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:52.910
You can do a few more things.
I'm just going to say,

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:55.700
as an assistant education save and create.

00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:58.970
Then I'll go over to my settings once
more and make sure that for the users,

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:03.020
this model is whitelisted. I'll add one
more. Debra Notice she's an option now.

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:06.050
And if Bernard's going to try
and use Debra and say Debra

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:10.730
paper for me on the Civil War.

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:16.040
And immediately I was shut down saying,
Hey, that's cheating. Now Llama two,

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:19.725
the model we're using, it's okay. There's
a better one called mixed roll Lemme,

00:15:20.295 --> 00:15:23.960
lemme show you Terry. I'll
use Deborah or Deb and say,

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:26.570
write me a paper on Benjamin Franklin.

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:30.860
I notice how it didn't write it for
me, but it says it's going to guide me.

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:33.380
And that's what I told
it to do to be a guide.

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:38.060
I tried to push it and it said
no. So that's pretty cool.

00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:39.710
You can customize these prompts,

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:42.980
put in some guard rails for people that
don't need full access to the kind of

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:45.350
stuff right now. I
think it's awesome. Now,

00:15:45.355 --> 00:15:47.300
OpenWeb UI does have a few
more bells and whistles,

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:49.550
but I want to move on to
getting stable diffusion set up.

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:54.140
This thing is so cool and powerful.
Step three, stable diffusion.

00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:58.700
I didn't think that image generation
locally would be as fun or as powerful as

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:03.320
chat GPT, but it's more, it's
crazy. You got to see it.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:08.030
Now we'll be installing Stable diffusion
with a UI called Automatic 1 1 1 1.

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.160
So let's knock it out.
Now before we install it,

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.860
we got some prereqs and one
of them is an amazing tool.

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:15.230
I have been using a lot called PI ENV,

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:18.620
which helps us manage our Python
versions and switch between them,

00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:20.540
which is normally such a pain. Anyways,

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:23.060
the first thing we got to do is make
sure we have a bunch of prerequisites

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:25.820
installed. Go ahead and copy and paste
this from the Network Check Academy.

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:28.670
Let it do its thing for a bit.
And with the prereqs installed,

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:29.780
we'll copy and paste this command,

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:33.860
a curl command that'll automatically do
everything for us. I love it. Run that.

00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:37.010
And then right here it tells us we need
to add all this or just run this command

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:41.300
to put this in our bash RC file. So we
can actually use the pie EMV command.

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.250
I'll just copy this, paste it,

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:49.550
and then we'll type in
source B RC to refresh our

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:52.550
terminal. And let's see
if pi ENV works, PI ENV,

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:56.060
we'll do a dash H to see if
it's up and running. Perfect.

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:59.330
Now let's make sure we have a version
of Python install that we will work for

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:03.800
most of our stuff. We'll do
PI ENV install three point 10.

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:07.100
This will of course install Python
three point 10, the latest version.

00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:09.140
Excellent Python three
point 10 is installed.

00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:13.610
We'll make it our global Python
by typing in PI ENV global

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:17.540
three point 10. Perfect.

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:20.570
And now we're going to
install automatic 1, 1, 1, 1.

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:24.350
The first thing we'll do is make a new
directory M-K-D-A-R for make directory,

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:29.180
we'll call it stable. And then
we'll jump in there. CD stable diff.

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:34.400
And then we'll use this W get
command to w get this BS script.

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:37.100
We'll type it Ls to make
sure it's there. There it is.

00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:40.130
Let's go ahead and make that sucker
executable by typing in CH mod.

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:45.470
We'll do a plus x and then web
UI sh. Now it's executable.

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:50.250
Now we can run it. Period
slash web ui sh. Ready,

00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:53.820
set, go. This is going
to do a lot of stuff.

00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:55.650
It's going to install everything
you need for open web ui.

00:17:56.250 --> 00:18:00.570
It's going to install PyTorch and
download stable diffusion. It's awesome.

00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:06.060
Again, a little coffee break.
Okay, that took a minute,

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:07.980
a long time. I hope you
got plenty of coffee.

00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:09.960
Now it might not seem like it's ready,

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:14.430
but it actually is running and you'll
see the URL pop up around here.

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:18.690
It's kind of messed up, but it's
running on port 78 60. Let's try it out.

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:21.570
And this is fun. Oh my gosh.

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:24.810
So local host 78 60,

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:29.550
what you're seeing here is hard
to explain. Lemme just show you

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:38.520
And let's generate, okay, it got confused.

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:41.610
Lemme take away the MPA Lupa part.
But this isn't being sped up.

00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:46.260
This is how fast this is. No, that's
a little terrible. What do you say?

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:50.160
We make it look a little bit
better. Okay, that's terrifying.

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:53.730
But just one of the many things
you can do with your own ai.

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.380
Now you can actually
download other models.

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:58.530
Lemme show you what it looks like on
Terry and my new editor, Mike, tell me,

00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:02.370
do this. That's weird. Let's
make it take more time.

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:03.870
But look how fast this is.

00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:06.810
It's happening in real time as
I'm talking to you right now.

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:09.990
But if you've ever made images with
GT four, it just takes forever.

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:13.980
But I just love the fact that this is
running on my own hardware and it's kind

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:17.130
of powerful. Lemme know in the comments
below, which is your favorite image,

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:20.550
actually post on Twitter
and tag me. This is awesome.

00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:24.630
Now this won't be a deep dive on Stable
Diffusion. I barely know what I'm doing.

00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:27.720
But let me show you real quick how
you can easily integrate automatic

00:19:27.725 --> 00:19:30.630
1, 1 1, 1 1. Did I have to
do enough ones? I'm not sure.

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:33.870
And they're stable diffusion
inside Open Web ui.

00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:35.820
So it's just right here
back at Open Web ui.

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:38.970
If we go down to our little
settings here and go to settings,

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:43.800
you'll see an option for images here. We
can put our automatic 1 1 1 1 base URL,

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:46.890
which will simply be HTTP colon whack wack

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.590
1 2 7 0 0 1,

00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:53.580
which is the same as saying
local host Port 78. What is it?

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:55.645
0 6 60 60 think is what it's,

00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:58.650
we'll hit the refresh option
over here to make sure it works.

00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:01.500
And actually no it didn't. And here's why.

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:02.880
There's one more thing you got to know.

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:05.790
Here we have OpenWeb UI
running in our terminal.

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:08.190
The head control C is going
to stop it from running.

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:10.140
In order to make it work with open web ui,

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:13.470
we got to use two
switches to make it work.

00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:18.660
So let's go ahead and run our script
one more time. Open web UI or web UI sh.

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:23.490
And we'll do dash listen
and dash API Once we see

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:27.960
the URL come up. Okay, cool, it's
running. We can go back over here and say,

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:29.790
why don't you try that
again buddy? Perfect.

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:32.130
And then over here we have
image Generation experimental.

00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:35.550
They're still trying it out.
We'll say on and we'll say save.

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:37.410
So now if we go to any prompt,

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:42.450
let's do a new chat and we'll
chat with llama two. I'll say,

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:46.170
describe a man in a dog suit.

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:51.760
This is for a stable diffusion prompt.

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:57.460
A bit wordy for my taste. But then notice
we have a new icon. This is so neat.

00:20:57.730 --> 00:20:59.710
Boom. An image icon.

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:02.860
And all we have to do is click on that
to generate an image based on that

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:07.210
prompt. I clicked on it, it's doing
it. And there it is right in line.

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:12.310
That is so cool. And that's really
terrifying. I love this. It's so fun.

00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:13.870
Now this video is getting way too long,

00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:15.460
but there are still two more
things I want to show you.

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:17.860
I'm going to do that really quickly
right now. The first one is,

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:22.180
it's just magic. Check it out. There's
another option here inside Open Web ui,

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:24.910
a little section right here
called Documents. Here.

00:21:24.915 --> 00:21:26.530
We can simply just add a document.

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:29.950
I'll add that one from before
it's there available for us.

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:33.460
And now when we have a new
chat, I'll chat with Code Gemma.

00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:36.580
All I have to do is do a hashtag and say,

00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:38.680
let's talk about this and say,

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:42.880
give me five bullet points about this.

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:48.040
Cool. Give me three social
media posts. Okay, go Gemma.

00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:52.720
Lemme try it again. What
just happened? Okay,

00:21:52.725 --> 00:21:56.980
let's do a new prop. Oh, there we go.
And I'm just scratching the surface.

00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:01.840
Now the second thing I want to show you,
last thing. I am a huge obsidian nerd.

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:04.090
It's my notes application.
It's what I use for everything.

00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:06.670
It's been very recent. I haven't
made a video about it, but I plan to.

00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:08.230
But one of the cool things about this,

00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:12.730
this very local private notes taking
application is that you can add your own

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:16.240
local GBT to it, like what we
just deployed. Check this out.

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:20.110
I'm going to go to settings. I'll go to
community plugins. I'll browse for one.

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:23.830
I'm going to search for one
called B-M-O-B-M-O Chatbot.

00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:27.820
I'm going to install that, enable it.
And then I'm going to go to settings.

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:31.570
I'll have BMO chatbots. And right
here I can have an Alama connection,

00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:33.880
which is going to connect
to let's say Terry.

00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:38.710
So I'll connect 'em to Terry and I'll
choose my model. I'll use Llama two,

00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:41.590
why not? And now right here in my note,

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:45.640
I can have a chat bot come right
over here to the side and say like,

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:49.750
Hey, how's it going? And I can do
things like look at the help file,

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:52.000
see what I can use here.
Ooh, turn on reference.

00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:53.080
So I'm going to say reference on,

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:56.470
it's now going to reference
the current note I'm in.

00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:01.960
Tell me about the system prompt.

00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:03.370
Yep, there it is.

00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:05.620
And it's actually going through and
telling me about the note I'm in.

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:07.060
So I have a chat bot right there,

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:10.120
always available for me to ask
questions about what I'm doing.

00:23:10.125 --> 00:23:12.130
And I can even go in here
and go highlight this,

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:15.880
do a little prompt,

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:19.540
select generate it's generating right
now and just generate some stuff for me.

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:22.180
I'm going to undo that.
Let me do another note.

00:23:22.185 --> 00:23:24.250
So I want to tell a story
about a man in a dog suit.

00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:29.800
I'll quickly talk to my chat bot and start
to do some stuff that's pretty crazy.

00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:34.660
And this I think for me is just
scratching the surface of running local AI

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:37.300
private in your home on your own hardware.

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:40.510
This is seriously so powerful and I can't
wait to do more stuff with this. Now.

00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:42.880
I would love to hear what you've
done with your own projects.

00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:45.410
If you attempted this, if you
have this running in your lab,

00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:47.090
let me know in the comments below. Also,

00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:50.390
do you know of any other cool projects
I can try that I can make a video about?

00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:53.480
I will love to hear that. I think
AI is just the coolest thing,

00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:55.880
but also privacy is a big concern for me.

00:23:55.880 --> 00:24:00.860
So to be able to run AI locally and
play with it this way is just the best

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:02.540
thing ever. Anyways, that's all I got.

00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:04.940
If you want to continue the
conversation and talk more about this,

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:06.350
please check out our Discord community.

00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:09.050
The best way to join that is to jump
through our Network Check Academy

00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:12.230
membership, the free one. And if you
do want to join the paid version,

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:13.730
we do have some extra
stuff for you there too,

00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:15.230
and it'll help support what we do here.

00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:17.630
But I'd love to hang out with you
and talk more. That's all I got.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:19.165
I'll catch you guys next time. I.
