00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.980
This is one of those things
you didn't know you needed,

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.400
but you'll end up using it every day.
Copy and paste in the terminal. Now,

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.380
I know it sounds stupid,
but seriously, it's so cool.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:08.640
So in this five minute Friday,

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.250
I'm going to show you how to
copy and paste in your terminal.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.290
Now you're probably thinking,
Chuck, we already have this solved.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.140
We can already copy something and
paste it right into our terminal,

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.640
and we can also copy from our
terminal control shift C and I got it.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.150
So what am I talking about? Maybe
I want to do this cat a large file.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.540
This is a transcript of one of my YouTube
videos and pipe that sucker right into

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.650
my clipboard just like that and paste it
anywhere I want. That's a lot of stuff.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.170
Or maybe I want to copy everything
from this article right here,

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.290
the entire page, which if I normally
pasted that into my terminal, it would be,

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.540
yeah, based. Anyway, chaos. Stop it. Stop.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.110
I can just do this and pipe
that into any command I want,

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.770
like maybe fabric to summarize the
article for me, which by the way,

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.110
fabric is amazing. Go watch my
video on that right now. Now,

00:00:52.115 --> 00:00:56.220
this doesn't happen by default,
these commands, PB copy and PB paste,

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.500
they don't exist, at least
not on Linux or Windows.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.600
They do exist on Mac and they're amazing.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.690
So if you're a Mac user tutorial
over what I just showed you,

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.870
you can do it right now. You're
welcome. Walk away, get some coffee.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.230
I'll see you later. But if you're a
Linux user or a Windows user using WSL,

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.940
I found a way to make this magic happen.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.670
Now because this is a five minute
Friday, I got to move fast. Oh,

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.310
and by the way, I'm doing five
minute Fridays. If you like these.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.150
Let me know if you have any suggestions
for content. Comment below. Also,

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.430
have you hacked the YouTube
algorithm today? Have you not?

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.400
Let's make sure you do hit that
like button subscribe. Comment.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.000
You got to hack YouTube today, ethically,
of course. Anyways, enough With that,

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.160
we're going to launch our
terminal. If you're on Linux,

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.430
just launch the terminal. If you're
on Windows, launch your WSL terminal.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.240
The first thing we'll do is install
something called Excel. No, not Excel.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.620
Excel. It's a command line program used
to access and manipulate the clipboard.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.040
So we'll install that
with a PT. Install, Excel,

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.100
the little pseudo action at the
beginning. And when that's done,

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.310
you're pretty much done. And we can
throw stuff on the clipboard like this.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.440
Let's do a little, you name dash R,

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.840
and we'll pipe that out to this
command Excel dash input dash

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.950
dash clipboard. Let's see if
it worked. Bam, there it is.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.700
Or I can copy something and I can
paste it in with Excel dash output,

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.990
dash clipboard. I can save it
to a file. Let's say file txt

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.090
and there it all is, but we don't
want to type that in every time.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.870
These commands are long, so we'll make
an alias or a nickname for this command.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.880
To do that, we'll jump
into our bash RC file,

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.320
nano tilda slash bash rc.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.800
And right up here at the top, you can
put this really anywhere you want.

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.540
We can define our aliases. We'll
type in alias, and we'll say PB copy.

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.170
That will be our command. And we'll
say equals this command opening.

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.430
Single quote, we'll say Excel, dash
dash input dash dash clipboard.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.080
We'll do the same thing for PB paste.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.190
Alias pb paste equals Excel

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.620
output dash clipboard, and that's
pretty much it. We'll hit control x,

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.030
Y and enter to save.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.080
We'll type in source tilda slash RC to
refresh our terminal and start using

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.790
that file. Now, let's try it out.
We'll echo, Hey, does this work?

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.650
And we'll pipe that into PB copy
and let's see if it did. Awesome.

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.210
It totally did. Let's put it
right back in PB paste. Boom.

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.970
There it is. Now you can make these
commands, whatever you want it to be.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.770
You can make it simply copy and paste.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.560
I did this because I have a Mac and
I don't want to get confused. Now,

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.290
you might be done, but what if you
want to log into a remote server,

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.920
another Linux server and still have
this clipboard action? You can do that.

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.150
Just a few simple steps. Now,

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.440
keep in mind this scenario only works
for Linux servers logging into another

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.020
Linux server. You can
also do this with WSL,

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.230
which is Linux logging
into a Linux server.

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.860
What doesn't work is Windows
logging into a Linux server.

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.780
You can try to make it
work. It's not a good time,

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:47.770
just don't even think about it.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.690
And we only have to do two
things to make this work.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.730
And it's all going to be
on the remote server. One,

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.380
we have to make sure that Excel
XL is installed on your remote

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.460
server. Two,

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.090
you got to make sure X 11 forwarding
is enabled on that remote server,

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.880
which is a really cool feature that
allows you to run a program on one server,

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.560
but display the graphics on another.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.620
We're going to use that to do
some clipboard magic. Thankfully,

00:04:08.625 --> 00:04:11.170
it's kind of enabled by default,
but we'll check to make sure.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.030
So first I'm going to get
logged into my remote server.

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.740
I'll jump into my AI server. Terry.

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.170
First thing we'll do is make
sure we have X Excel installed.

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.100
Pseudo A PTI install Excel. I
already do. Step one is done.

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.520
Now let's check step two. Let's make
sure X 11 forwarding is enabled.

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:25.840
Let's quickly cat this file.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.640
We'll CAT E-T-C-S-S-H-S-S-H-D
underscore config,

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.020
and we'll GRE for X 11 just like
this. And if you're new to Grip,

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.850
all that did is simply search the file
and output only lines with X 11 in it.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.090
And we can see right here
we have X 11 forwarding yes,

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.400
and it's not commented out.
Notice this one down here,

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.090
X 11 forwarding no is commented
out. So it's not an active config.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.470
Now if you don't see the yes,

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.620
you'll need to jump into that
file with nano and edit that.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.350
So we might say nano Etsy, SSH,

00:04:57.225 --> 00:05:01.540
SSH D config. Make sure
this line of config exists.

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.130
Control X, Y enter to save, and then
we'll do a pseudo system, CT L, restart,

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.490
SS H, and that may log you
out. And you know what? I lied.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.080
There is a third thing
we might want to do,

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.070
and that's set up our aliases because
our aliases exist on our host system

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:18.310
either in WSL or Linux, but they
don't exist on the new system.

00:05:18.315 --> 00:05:23.170
We'll have to add those there as well.
So same story, nano, Tilda, Matilda,

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.240
anyone do that in their head
when they say that? Anyways,

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.020
bash RC and I already have mine here. But
go ahead and add yours just like this.

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:30.700
Once you have all that config there,

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.010
we're going to actually disconnect
from the server. So just type in exit.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.330
We're back in our host system,

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.300
and this time we're going to connect
back to it with a special switch.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.710
So we'll do s, s, H, and here's the
difference. We'll do dash capital X,

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.700
which will force us to use
X 11 forwarding, and then
business as usual network,

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.280
Chuck, or whatever your
username is at your server.

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.630
So now I can copy and paste on a
remote server with no problems.

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.830
Let's try a copy real quick. Yep, like.

00:05:56.835 --> 00:06:01.130
A five minute Friday. Was that five
minutes? It probably wasn't. I'm sorry,

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.130
but I hope this was helpful. I
seriously use this every single day,

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:05.690
especially when I'm playing with fabric.

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:08.420
And I would love to hear if you install
this or if you have any tips or tricks

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:11.300
for me, or if you have an amazing tip,
I would love to share that. And also,

00:06:11.305 --> 00:06:13.730
if you want to support what I do and
learn some cool stuff along the way,

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:17.510
check out network. Chuck Academy, link
below. That's my baby, my project.

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.240
I'm pouring all of my energy into it,
and it's a place where we can hang out.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.550
So I hope to see you there. That's
all I got. I'll get you next time.
