00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.640
Are you ready to go deeper and Python?

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.330
I hope you are because this is
episode two of my free Python course,

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.430
where I'm going to teach you everything
you need to know to become dangerous

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:12.683
in Python.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.040
So here we go, armed with coffee
and the knowledge from episode one,

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.080
where we talked about strings and things.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.530
We're now moving on to talk about one
of the most fundamental things in Python

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.310
and really just programming in general
variables. The variables are fun.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.160
I can't wait to show you now. What
do you need to learn this? Well,

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.050
just like episode one, nothing.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.080
I have a free Python lab available
in the description. Seriously.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.580
It's amazing right here from your browser,

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.940
you can program in Python or even
from your phone. It's awesome. Oh,

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.540
and almost forgot you need coffee. It's
just required. I didn't make the rules.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.370
And also a massive shout
out to the sponsor of this
entire series and why it can

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.860
be free here on YouTube. It pro TV.

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.160
I use it pro TV to learn
pretty much everything in it.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.660
From networking to hacking.

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.120
If you want to get your CCNA
or A-plus or Linux plus,

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.660
or pretty much whatever that got
you back with amazing top notch,

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.530
video training and hands-on labs
and Python did. I mentioned Python.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.340
They had these amazing Python courses
that cover some fun stuff like Python for

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.850
security and Python for
networking professionals.
That's just cool. So anyways,

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:18.570
you want, wanna check them out?

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.150
You definitely should use my link
below where code network Chuck,

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.680
and get 30% off forever. Now I need
your help with something you and me.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.660
We're going to start a
coffee shop together. Yes.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.030
It's going to be called the
network. chuck.coffee, coffee shop.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.390
We'll work on the name and to do that,
we're going to be a bit geeky about it.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.300
We're going to program our own
baristas. So here in this video,

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.060
we're going to write some code to
automate our baristas. How cool was that?

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.640
Anyway, let's do this. So go ahead
and launch your lab. Check that link.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.860
And the description again is going
to be right here in your browser.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.600
And it's so cool. First quick review.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.810
What the junk is that judging
by the hashtag in front of it?

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.460
Hashtag that's comment, right? Telling
us it's for us and not the computer.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.020
So yeah, we're starting
a coffee shop together.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.210
Let's add one more comment to
talk about what we're about to do.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.590
Put a hashtag in. Let's build a robot
barista. Now again, quick review.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.640
When we click run to run this code, what's
going to show up right here. Try it.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.240
Nothing because the computer ignored all
this stuff. Let's give us some stuff.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.660
It can't ignore. Let's do this
now first with any great barista.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.360
We want them to say a greeting.
When someone comes in, hello,

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.690
welcome to network chuck.coffee. So
let's make our computer barista say that.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.870
How would you do that? Well, simple
right? To make our computer talk.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.140
We print print using a
print function parentheses.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.360
And then between those parentheses,
we'll add what it should say,

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.070
which will be a string.
So we'll say hello,

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.350
welcome to network Chuck coffee. And
they've had a lot of coffee today.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.380
So at a bunch of exclamation
points, yes. A robot runs on coffee.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.060
You didn't know that.
And that's it. And again,

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.660
quick review print right here is our
function. It's got the parentheses.

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.010
And then in between those parentheses,

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.760
we have our string because it's
between quotes, which by the way,

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.150
did you say string like this
all day from the last episode,

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.840
if you did let me know in the discussion
or the comments and when we print this,

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.470
what do you think is going to show up
right here? Let's see. Is it programming?

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.080
Fun? This so fun. Let's hit run.
Cool. We made the computer talk.

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.300
So our robot barista,
he's already well-trained.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.330
He knows how to say hi to people, but
he needs to be more than that, right?

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.070
If you want us to
actually make coffee. Now,

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.300
if you've ever been to
a coffee shop, you know,

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.060
any good barista is going to ask you
what your name is so they can write that

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.010
sucker on the cup. Right? So here we go.

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.520
Let's make our robot barista ask you
what your name is. Prince string.

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.270
What is your name? So we get to
print functions, two strings.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.170
And if we click run on that sucker
run, cool. What's your name?

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.060
So we made our robot barista talk,

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.090
but how do we make it to where we
can talk back to our robot barista?

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.180
And he hears us. He takes the information
in that's our next cool thing.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.380
We're going to learn. So check this out.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.310
It's something called the
input function, who? Yes.

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.050
If I go in and type it
in with me right now,

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.730
just type in the word input and
then parentheses open and close.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.953
Yes, sir.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.050
This one's super cool and opens up
the door for us to have a lot of fun.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.850
The input function will solve our problem.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.080
This thing is designed to take input
from the user or our customers,

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.660
and also fun to know whatever
it takes from the user.

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.030
It will automatically
convert it to a string,

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:04.090
which will become more important later.
What we'll talk about that, but anyways,

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.470
let's see an action. So check it out.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.550
So what we're going to do is use the
input function to get our customer's name.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.190
So actually we're going to remove this
print function. Let's get it out of here.

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.560
We all need the print function
anymore for this purpose. Anyway.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.370
So take them out. Goodbye. We're gonna
put the input function in his place. Now,

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.560
in order for our robot
barista, to ask the question,

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.810
we're gonna actually put a
string between these parentheses,

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.680
just like the pro function. So right
there, we'll put what's is your name.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.900
So now let's run it. I
don't want to wait anymore.

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.910
Just click on run and
let's see what happens.

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:34.540
What's what's happening.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.660
Our script is still running and it seems
like it's waiting on us to do something

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.230
because it is, it is it's waiting on
our input or our customer's input.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.020
So right here in our command
line, it's just kind of chilling.

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.940
So let's answer it. Just start typing
right there. I'll type in a Bob on Bob.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.030
And we did it. We told our
computer what our name was,

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.720
but that was kind of anti-climactic
like, w what happened?

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.490
We hadn't seen anything
happen from that. Yes.

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:58.870
The computer asked us what our name was.

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.530
And we were able to tell him
we didn't do anything with it.

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.260
Now we could do this. We could
actually print our input function,

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.630
which makes me feel like inception,
but let's try it out real quick.

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.350
So let's just put prints around this
I'll type print in front of input,

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.320
and then put in parentheses
one before it one after it.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.410
So essentially this is what's so
cool about programming. Goodness.

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.230
The input function is inside
of the print function. Now,

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:27.700
what do you think will happen
here? Positivity to think
about it. Okay. Resume.

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.790
When we run this code, what's going
to happen. Let's go ahead and do it.

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.000
Click on run. So same thing as before,
it's going to ask us for our input.

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.990
What's your name, buddy? Bob. And
then it told us back it printed it,

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.220
which is cool in theory, but useless
for our robot barista. What we,

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.230
wasn't your barista to go, Hey, what's
your name? You say bobbin. He goes, Bob,

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.230
what good is that? But it is cool again,

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:50.650
that we can print our input function here
and have the result given back to us,

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.200
but we don't need that. So let's
take the print function off of it.

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.320
So let's move on and talk about how it
can make our robot barista do something

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.730
with the name that we give it. So
right after our input function,

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:01.370
let's do another pro function,
enter a few times type in prince,

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.940
do our parentheses, and then we'll do a
string. So quotes and I'll say, hello,

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.380
and I want the person's name to be here.

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.500
So I'm just gonna kind of put some
filler here, some periods, pillow.

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.540
Thank you so much for coming
in today. Instead of periods,

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.320
I could just put in Bob. Hello,
Bob, thank you for coming in today,

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:21.050
but it might not always be Bob that
comes in. I would hope so. Right?

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:23.930
I hope I have more than
one customer than Bob. Uh,

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:27.200
it might be Susan or Patricia
or Dave. I don't know.

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.040
How can we program our robot barista to
say something like someone's name when

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.660
it varies? Well, you probably saw this.
Kelvin will use something called a very,

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:40.250
a bull. You see what I did there?
Anyways, here we go. Variables variables,

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.910
a variable as a method of storing
data for reuse, for example,

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:45.800
a name we may want our
robot barista to act,

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.870
to remember a name when
the customer tells them.

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.180
So we'll do that here in a second,
but first let's create a variable.

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.070
Let's just play with them real
quick. So here in our code,

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.330
the first thing I want
you to do real quick,

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.760
let's see if you remember this
comment out, all your code.

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:57.710
So the robot barista we'll ignore it.

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:02.240
The way we can do that is by adding a
hashtag or a pound sign in front of all

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:06.590
our commands or functions here,
hashtag hashtag hashtag. Okay,

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.530
so now the computer ignores that
we run the code. Nothing again.

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:12.200
That's handy to do when you want
to just test out stuff and, uh,

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:15.710
have the computer. Ignore it anyways.
So just blow all that type in this.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.710
This is how we create a variable
type in name, no parentheses,

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:23.420
no quotation marks. Just name that
interspace equals space. And here,

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:26.810
I want you to put in your name as a
string right after the equal sign.

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:31.220
But for me, I'll just put in quotations
to make it a string network, Chuck,

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:34.430
and that's it. We just made
a variable this right here,

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:37.820
name with nothing around it.
Just a word is a variable.

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:42.470
And we set that variable equal to the
string network. Chuck now real quick,

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:45.530
I want you to run the code and see what
happens going click run that. Yeah,

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:47.540
you clicked it. And
nothing happened, right?

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.250
Because all we did was create a variable,

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:51.650
but we didn't tell the computer to say
anything or do anything to the computer

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:53.540
is very literal. He'll
do whatever you tell him.

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:56.030
But it only exactly what you
tell him. So now just below that,

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:59.370
let's print that variable. So
do this type in print. Yeah.

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:03.080
You can print variables, put our print
seasons. So we have our print function.

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:06.590
And then just between those just type in
the variable name, just type the name.

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:10.580
No again, no quotations, no anything.
And then click run. Look at that.

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:12.620
We created a variable named name.

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:17.270
We said equal to the string of your
name in my case network, Chuck.

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:21.560
And then we printed the variable,
which came out right here. Now again,

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:25.220
the key characteristic of a variable is
that it can vary based on what you said

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:27.170
it two. So keep your same code here,

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:30.350
but just below it doesn't mean you can't
watch this. Do this again, type a name,

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:34.400
that same variable name and
send the equal to, I don't know,

00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:38.840
iron man iron man, the string iron
man. And then just below that code,

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:42.020
let's print that variable
again. Print name.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.210
What do you think going to
happen here? Let's try it out.

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:48.230
Go ahead and click on run. Right.
Whoa. How cool was that? Well,

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:52.250
here in our code, we define the variable
name, set it to equal network. Chuck,

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:54.590
the string or the string network.
Chuck. I said that backwards,

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:58.230
but then we changed our mind and set
the variable name equal to Ironman.

00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:01.470
And then we printed that. Okay. Now
that we know how to create a variable,

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:03.570
what do you say? We use
it for our barista robot.

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:07.020
Let's make him remember a customer's
name up here. And here's how we do that.

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:10.050
It's going to remove our variable
playground here. Just delete all that.

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:13.110
And let's uncomment our code
here to remove those hashtags.

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:15.480
So it's back in action. Now I
want to see if you can do this.

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:20.520
How do I set this input? Which will be
what we tell the computer or our robot.

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:24.030
How do we set that to become a
variable and store it as data?

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:27.600
Try it out real quick. Pause
the video and pause. Here we go.

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:29.880
It's as simple as this right
here in front of the input,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:30.870
I'm going to type in name,

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:35.580
defining a variable space
equals space. That's it.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:36.720
When we run this code,

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:41.250
we're saying create a variable named
name and that variable will equal

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:45.720
the input that we ask from the
user. What? Yeah, no. Let's,

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.700
let's try it out real quick
now to see that in action.

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:50.400
Let's real quick comment
out our last print function.

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:54.830
And then just below the name variable
where we set it. Let's print name now.

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:57.270
Let's see what happens. Let's
run the code run. Hello.

00:09:57.270 --> 00:10:00.960
Welcome the nurse at coffee. What's
your name? My name is Susan bam.

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:04.380
So what just happened there? Well, it
asked us for our name. We said, Susan,

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:08.730
the computer set the variable
name equal to Susan, a string.

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:12.150
And then we printed the variable
out, which is the string Susan.

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:16.260
So our next step is to use this in our
ingredient. So instead of saying, hello,

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.830
Bob, thank you for coming in today. We
want to say hello, the customer's name.

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:22.740
Thank you for coming in
today. Hello, the variable.

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:25.350
Thank you for coming in
today. Let's try it out now.

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:27.120
If you already know how
to do it, do by all means,

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:30.690
pause this video and go try it out because
it does involve a concept we learned

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:34.290
in episode one con cat nation
or adding stuff together.

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:35.760
Now we only added strings together,

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:38.880
but you can add more than just
strings together. Try it out,

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:40.560
but we're gonna walk through
it right now. Here we go. Woo.

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:42.240
So remove the extra print
function out of the way

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:46.140
and then uncomment our
original print function.

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:47.760
So we should have it just like this. Uh,

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:50.610
first what I'll do is just remove the
contents of this entire strings to start

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:55.440
from scratch. Start fresh. I'll start
with the string. Hello. And then,

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:56.460
you know, the name will come after.

00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:59.790
So let's just put a space there
then to concatenate stuff.

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:02.130
We just use the plus sign, right?
We're adding things together.

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:06.810
So I'll do a space plus space and
then simply I'll type in the variable

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:12.060
name. Just like that. Also keeping in
mind that I'm putting a space after hello,

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:15.150
cause remember the computer will literally
print out what you tell it to print.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:19.800
If you don't put a space there,
it'll just say hello, Susan.

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:21.840
Like it's all one word. Come on computer.

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:25.320
So you got to tell it what to do
anyway. So hello plus name again.

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:27.330
A variable has no quotations
or anything on it.

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:31.440
And then we'll add another string to
that. Plus start our new next string.

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:33.390
Put a space after that, but a comment.

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:38.670
Thank you so much for coming
in today. Now this is so cool.

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:41.250
Let's go ahead and run this code
and see what happens. Click on run.

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:46.110
It's going ask us your name.
Okay. My name is Bernard. What?

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:50.790
We're good at? That's so cool. We
programmed our robot barista to say hello,

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:53.320
Bernard. Thank you so
much for coming in today.

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:57.400
And actually I put an extra space that
shouldn't be there right before the COVID

00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:00.310
let's fix that and run it again.
Oh, better. It's gonna bother me.

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:01.300
How cool is that?

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:04.600
Now there is one thing I don't like
about this and that's the input.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.210
The question. What's your name?
And then we end up typing our name.

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:11.140
Like no space right after the question,
mark. That's ugly. How do you fix that?

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:13.330
Can you fix that for me? Real quick.
Pause the video. See if you can do it.

00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:17.020
I'm gonna fix mine right now. Right here
in the inputs. I can do a few things.

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:20.200
I can just add a space right after that
and that should fix it and we run that

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.690
code. So yeah. Now there's a space
there. So does it feel so jarring?

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:25.750
So if I type Bernard will be right
after that better, even better.

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:27.430
I could just instead of a space,

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:31.690
do a backslash N the lime break
character. Let's try that. Oh,

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:36.430
new line. That's even
better. Bernard. Perfect.

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:36.940
Now here,

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:39.220
I'm going to challenge for you and
I'll give you the answer in this video,

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:40.540
but first I'm we can try it yourself.

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:44.560
I want you to program the robot
barista to give the customer a menu,

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:48.910
ask them what they want, receive the
information and tell them, Hey Bernard,

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:53.020
whoever it is, your whatever they
ordered will be ready in a few moments.

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:57.370
And I want you to set that menu to be a
variable. So can you do it? Try it out,

00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:02.500
test it out. I'll wait, go and
pause the video now on pause.

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:06.340
Let's try it out. So first let's create
a quick coffee menu using a variable.

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:10.420
So I'll call my variable menu and
I'll equal that a simple string,

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:12.610
nothing too crazy. I'll say black coffee,

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:15.820
espresso latte,

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:20.440
Kappa Chino is a how you spell
it looks right. And that's good.

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:24.070
So right now we've got a variable menu.
It's equal to everything on our menu.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:27.280
Now let's have a robot barista ask the
customer what they want and give them the

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.260
menu. So here we go. There are
a number of ways to do this,

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.540
but I'm going to do it this way. First.
We'll do a print function, prince.

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:35.260
And I'll say the name variable.
That'll add a string to it. Comma.

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:39.910
What would you like from our menu today?

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:44.470
Here is what we are serving and
the right within that string.

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:47.920
I'll do a line break and then
I'll add something else to this.

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:49.180
I'll add our menu.

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:53.740
So this should say the
variable name, then the string.

00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:55.900
What would you like from our menu
today? Here's what we are serving.

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:59.290
And then it'll say the variable menu.
Let's try it out. Let's run this code.

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:04.000
Hello? What's your name? My name
is Susan. Oh, how cool is that?

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:08.080
I'm going to add some extra space right
here. Oh, it looks a bit more clean.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:11.260
So I'll add that in that print
statement. See how it looks now, Susan,

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:14.770
get that looks better. So now let's
get the input from our customer.

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.810
I'm gonna create another
variable. I'll name it order.

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:20.200
And I'll have that equal input. Uh, for
this. I don't have to do anything fancy.

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:21.580
I'll just keep the input like this.

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:23.170
That's not going to print
anything or say anything,

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:25.960
but it will still expect input
from the user. Let's try it out.

00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:29.770
Let's run the code. Bernard is my name.
And now it's waiting for me to answer.

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:32.710
I'll see. I don't know, latte.
Cool. So it took the input.

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:35.470
Now we have to do something with it. We
have to do something with our variable.

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.610
Let's do our next print statement.
And this is our final task in the, uh,

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:41.530
the project here. I'm going
to print. Sounds good.

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:46.030
Then I'll add the variable name. Then
I'll add string. I'll do a comma.

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:47.740
We'll have that.

00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:51.500
And then I'll add the variable order
and then I'll add another string right

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:54.470
after that, which looks crazy.
Right. But it's going to be so cool.

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:56.210
Ready for you

00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:01.100
and a moments now that's a lot
of stuff going on. It's so cool.

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:06.230
Because right now we're adding three
strings and two variables together in

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:09.470
one print function, which is nuts.
Let's go in print. Let's do it print.

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:12.920
And here's our complete script. What's
your name? Bernard. Here's our menu.

00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:17.360
What would you like? Hmm, definitely
a black coffee. Sounds good.

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:20.960
Bernard will have that black coffee
ready for you in a moment you go robot

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:23.240
barista. You're doing so good.
I'm going to give you a tip now.

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:25.730
Real quick challenge for you. I know we
got a lot of challenges, but one more.

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:27.500
And I want you to comment
below with the answer.

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:30.920
How would I combine these two
parts of the script right here?

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:35.240
Let me know who episode two, coming in
strong. We learned two big things today.

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.280
First, the input function, how we can,

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:40.400
instead of just saying things
to our customer or the user,

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:44.180
we can actually request data from them
and have our robot reach to do something

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:45.710
with it. How cool is that?

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:49.580
But it's useless unless we can remember
that input and do something with it

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:52.490
later in our scripts, which
brings us to variables.

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:56.000
And we used both of those powerful
concepts to create a robot barista,

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:59.930
which is really cool right now, but
we can make it a lot more amazing,

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:03.620
a lot more powerful, which we'll do
in the coming episodes. But anyways,

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:04.610
that's all I got for you today.

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:06.140
