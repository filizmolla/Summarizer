If EIF Else, if,

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.560
if else you got it.
Okay. Let's get started.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.800
Welcome to episode five
in my Python right now,

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.430
series where I'm gonna teach you
everything you pretty much need to know to

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.830
become dangerous and Python. Now,

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.990
if you don't know what I was talking
about in the intro print that's okay.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.270
But go back and watch the previous
episode else. Let's continue.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:33.270
Because in this episode,

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.190
we're gonna build on our flow control
or controlling the flow of our Python

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.620
programming. If something is true,
then do something. And in the episode,

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.580
you helped me prevent evil bin from
entering our coffee shop. We said,

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.180
if evil bin comes in, kick a mapped
else, Hey, you're good to go continue.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.780
But now we gotta build on that because
I figured out not all bins are evil,

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.300
who would've thought. So there
are some good bins out there.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.300
So we now have to put into our Python
programming a way to flesh out the evil

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.090
bins and let the good
ones in. But to do that,

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.690
we have to introduce some new concepts
of how we control the flow in our Python

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.250
programming, who this one's
gonna be fun. So get ready,

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.330
get your coffee set up because that's
pretty much all you need in this because

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.210
I'm providing a free Python lab right
here in your browser. Check it out.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.630
Link below,

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.010
get signed up because the best way to
learn Python is to actually just do it to

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.920
lab it up. And you're gonna do that
right now, here with me. Oh, by the way,

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.000
this entire series is free. Thanks
to our sponsor. It pro TV. Now,

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.280
if you don't know what it pro TV is print,

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.600
you're crazy because they are the
best it training platform out there.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.960
They're what I use to
keep my skills up to date.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.000
And that's why I love them because they
have things for people at every level in

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.400
their it journey. So for me, I've
been doing things for a while,

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.440
so they have perfect things
to help me upskill my,

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:43.630
I don't know why I said that weird.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.870
And also if you're just like
getting started starting at zero,

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.710
they have everything for you from getting
started with your a plus certification

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:49.683
to network,

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.030
plus to jumping up to your CCNA and then
maybe becoming a hacker and they have

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.150
hacking courses, they got
it all. And not only that,

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.270
you're not just gonna be sitting there
watching a video. They have labs,

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.230
the things they teach you,

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.350
you can implement immediately
start playing with it right away.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.980
So if you love it and you wanna earn
like me to not mean that's a rhyme,

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.900
check it out, link below. And
if you use code network, Chuck,

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.380
you get 30% off forever.
So check him out. Okay.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.140
Quick coffee break. Before we get started,
gotta fill up just a little bit. Ah,

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.980
network chuck.coffee.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.260
Now first let's go ahead and get our
Python lab environment fired up. So again,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.420
check that link of the description.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.850
Sign up for my free course and launch
that first flab for episode five.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.250
Last episode, we did a great job.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.770
Keeping evil Ben out of the coffee
shop with yo bro, what's your name?

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.130
And if he said, Ben, dude, we
printed. You're not welcome here.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.410
Kick him out and exit. Let's
test it out real quick.

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.810
Let's go ahead and run this code, click
it on a run right here at the top run.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.370
What's your name? Let's
just say we're Ben today.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.850
We're Ben feeling kind
of evil. Whoa, immediate.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.840
Now I have to apologize to you Ben,

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.760
because not all Bens are evil and we
have to reflect that in our script right

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.880
now we gotta figure out, Hey,

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.360
is Ben evil and what's the best way to
find out if a Ben is evil, it's simple,

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:57.960
right? You just, you just ask him.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.000
So let's ask Ben an evil person will
be honest. So here's our first task.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.280
If their name is Ben, we need
to ask them, Hey, are you evil?

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.960
If they answer yes, kick 'em out.
If they answer no we'll then duh,

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.200
they're not evil. And they
can continue on real quick.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.240
Before I show you how to do this.
And this will be a new concept.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.760
I wanna have you try it.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.320
This will help you kind of understand
the logic of we're about to do so pause

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.350
and try to do this On pause. Let
me walk you through it real quick.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.870
So the first task in this task is
we have to ask Ben, are you evil?

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.670
But we only need to ask Ben, like,

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.270
if we put the question up here and
like Brittany comes in, we're like,

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:33.870
what's your name, Brittany,
are you evil, Brittany?

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.830
That wouldn't make any sense.
Cuz only Ben's are evil.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.790
So we have to accommodate for that logic.

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.500
So we need to ask only
bends if they're evil.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.180
So the question's gonna have to
go over here in our if statement.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.820
So that's where I'll put it.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.260
I'll put it right on top of this first
print statement. So I'll get in there.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:47.700
I'll put my cursor at the end of the,

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.820
if statement hit enter and
I'll create a new variable,

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.500
I'll say evil underscore status
and I'll have that equal.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:54.820
And this will be an input function.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.100
Cause I'm gonna be asking Ben a question
input and I'll say the string or you

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.050
and evil question mark.

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.090
And I'll do a back slash end to
have a nice little space. So cool.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.490
We're now finding out if Ben is evil and
this evil status will either answer or

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.250
equal to yes or no. And we have to
do something with that information.

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.850
If it's yes, we have to kick him out.
If it's no, we have to let him come in.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.010
It sounds like we might need
another if statement, right?

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.800
If you thought that you're
exactly right. New concept time,

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.560
we're talking about
something called nested ifs.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.080
We're gonna build a nest of ifs here
and check it out. Here's what we'll do.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.720
We'll go and just do this right now.
So just after our evil status equals,

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:32.460
are you evil?

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.600
I'm gonna enter and I'm gonna create
another if statement and notice it's

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.160
nested, it's underneath this other. If
Python's getting crazy, man, here we go.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.350
If and now we're, we're going
to evaluate the evil status.

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.230
If evil status equals are double
equals and we'll say the string,

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.350
yes. Then we'll put our colon.
If that evaluates the true,

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.510
then we're doing something. Look
at this. We got two ifs. If, if,

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.470
if that's what's happening here
now here's the power of nested ifs.

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.940
First we're saying if the
name is Ben than do something.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.380
And when we nest that next, if
under that, we're saying also, Hey,

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.260
if his name is Ben and he's
evil. If the evil status is yes,

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:13.100
then do something. If both of
those things are true and remember,

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:16.740
keep an eye on that. Spacing the
indentation. The reason we know this,

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.740
if statement is nested under that, if
is because it's indented under it now,

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.530
knowing how I and spacing is,
let me ask you a question.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.010
Will this print statement run? If
Ben is evil, the answer is yes,

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.690
because right now that code
is nested under the initial.

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.050
If statement and that all that's
evaluating for is if your name is Ben.

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.450
So regardless of your evil
status, if your name is Ben,

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.850
it's gonna run that code. So now we have
to make sure that we only run the code.

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.720
If your name is Ben and your
evil, how do we do that?

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.120
Well with understanding how
important spacing is a Python. Again,

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.440
I'm gonna mention that a lot. We need
to nest that code underneath the second.

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.560
If statement that way it'll only run.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.840
If your name is Ben and
you are indeed evil.

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.760
So over here on our if statement or I
mean our print statement right here,

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:59.960
just gonna backspace that,

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.760
then I'm gonna tab it over to be nested
right there and also for the exit as

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.240
well. It's gonna tab that underneath.
So now, now it's gonna work.

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:09.150
So at this point,

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.960
this code right here will only
run if their name is Ben and

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.670
Ben is evil. If his name is just
Ben, it'll move on right along.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.950
Let's try it out real quick. Let's
go ahead and run our code run.

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:23.150
What's your name? We are still evil.
Ben today. Evil Ben or just Ben,

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:28.270
are you evil? Let's say yes. We're
not welcome here. Let's try it again.

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.070
Click on run this time. We won't
be evil. We we'll still be Ben,

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:34.590
but we'll be one of those rare Bens
that aren't evil. Are you evil? No.

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:39.180
Now cool. Something just happened
there. First. We didn't get kicked out,

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.660
but we also didn't get a
nice, like friendly greeting,

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:44.260
like the robot baristas program
to do. We didn't get this.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.300
Why do you know this else?

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.740
Statement will only
run if that isn't true.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.500
Cuz it's in line with
this. If statement again,

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:54.940
spacing an indentation is
so important at Python.

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:56.900
It might be one of your bigger headaches,

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.370
but once you learn it and get used
to it, it'll be your best friend.

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.570
So that else is tied to this. If
statement based on the spacing.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:06.170
So if your name is Ben cool, we're
gonna run everything under here.

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:07.890
If your name isn't Ben,
we're gonna run this.

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:12.330
So now we need to add some code to
make Ben feel a little special cuz Hey,

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:15.290
non evil Bens are pretty special. So
let's, let's do something real quick.

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:17.970
Actually. Let's see if you can do
it. How can we make Ben feel special?

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:21.560
How can we make the non Bens feel
welcome? So do something similar here.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.640
I don't care what you're
right, but make Ben feel good.

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:28.400
Pause the video and try it. UN
pause. Let's try it out real quick.

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.400
Here's what I'm gonna try.
Just like we can nest our ifs.

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:36.600
We can also nest our ELs. So here
we go. Who, who Python gets crazy.

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:40.150
I'm gonna put my cursor right
over next to my exit. Hit enter.

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:45.070
And then I'll do a shift tab to back out
to where I'm in line with that nested.

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:48.870
If and here is where I'll
type in my else. Else.

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:53.910
Colon hit enter and here is where
I'll make Ben feel welcome print.

00:07:55.610 --> 00:08:00.460
Oh, so you're one of
those good Ben come on in.

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.820
So bam, just right here.
Who we've got an entire,

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.940
if L statement thing going on,

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:10.900
that's nested inside this if statement
and all this code right here will only

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:14.300
run if their name is Ben. Not enough
talking about it. Let's run our code.

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.980
I'm so excited. Coffee break, click on
run. And we'll be Ben. This time run.

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:22.610
What's your name? I'm still Ben. Am I
evil? Let's say no, no I'm good. Ben.

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:25.650
Today it worked. So you're one
of those good Bens. Come on in.

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:28.890
Let's be evil again. Let's make sure
our code works. Test it thoroughly.

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:32.890
What's your name? My name is Ben.
Are you evil? Yes, I got kicked out.

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:36.210
Oh my gosh. And let's test it one
more time. Let's make sure that um,

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:39.330
Brittany can still come in Brittany. Okay.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:41.600
And she just comes up on through
cuz her name's not Ben, obviously.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:45.280
She's okay now isn't that just
awesome. And let me tell you,

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:49.600
you can do a ton of ifs.
Check it out. I can do,

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:54.360
if two is less than
three, then do something.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:58.680
I can even nest an if
under that nested. If so,

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:03.040
if one is greater than
four than do something,

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:07.840
I could continually nest as many ifs
as my heart desires and go crazy.

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:11.160
Now you shouldn't do that because
that's insane. But try it real quick.

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:14.280
See how many, if you can nest, how
many things you can test out go.

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:16.070
The cool part is that that works,

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:18.870
but it gets messy and confusing
and you would never wanna do that.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:21.510
Also keeping in mind that
at the very bottom of your,

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:24.830
if craziness on the last little
if statement, it's saying,

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:28.950
if this is true and this is true and
this is true, then this will happen.

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:30.190
All of those have to be true.

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:33.230
And that's where nested ifs really come
in handy is if you wanna make sure that

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:35.660
multiple things are true
at the the same time,

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.540
but now there's something else
that's even more powerful. Uh,

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:40.580
probably equally powerful.
It's all awesome.

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:44.020
And it's gonna help us with our menu.
You see right now, robot barista,

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:47.580
he's doing a good job and tell you what
go and open up the second lab for this

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:50.660
episode, episode five. And we'll
get going here in episode four.

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:54.220
And in the bonus lab we had after
it, we made some changes to our menu.

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.810
We took a big leap in and we
added frappuccinos to our menu.

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:02.050
So we added it here. And the big kicker
was that frappuccinos cost more money.

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:04.010
They're just more expensive
to make. So as it was,

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:08.610
we charged $8 for whatever someone
ordered a black coffee latte, cappuccino,

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:12.130
all eight bucks, frappuccinos cost us
more. So we had to charge more for it.

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:15.970
So we had to find a way to make
our price be different. If they,

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:20.120
he ordered a frappuccino, we did that
with a beautiful, just a beautiful, wow,

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:24.200
chef's kiss. If statement, sorry for
that. Um, and we did that right down here.

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.640
We said, Hey, if the customer
ordered a frappuccino, dude,

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:30.520
that price is gonna be $13. Cuz
that's, that's some bougie stuff else.

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:33.400
If it's regular stuff like we
have on the menu if eight bucks,

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:34.840
but now we have a new problem.

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:38.230
You see customers complaining that our
prices should not be the same for all

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:41.390
coffees. Black coffee by
itself should be less than $8.

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:43.070
So shouldn't espresso a lot.

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:45.310
They should be a bit more and a
cappuccino should be a bit more.

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:48.070
We need to make sure that our
menu items have different prices.

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:50.390
Now this will be a fun one and I'm
going to introduce a new concept.

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:51.323
But before I do that,

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:54.990
I want you to try this with
just if statements it is
possible and it's gonna be

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:56.990
a bit messy, but I want you
to try it, pause the video,

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:01.940
get the logic behind it and go, All right,

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:03.900
UN pause. Now here's how you
would do it. The messy way.

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.780
We could simply make a bunch
of these, a bunch of these.

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:10.260
If statements like this, watch just
take that copy, paste that here and say,

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.780
instead of Rapino gimme black
coffee and we'll make that price $3.

00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:16.820
That sounds reasonable. Right? You would
get some black coffee for three bucks.

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:18.610
Yeah, come down and we'll do it again.

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:22.210
Espresso latte and then cappuccino and
tell you what let's go ahead and remove

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:23.530
our else's cuz this will mess things up.

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:26.530
So remove each else and also think
about why that would mess things up.

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:27.850
I'll explain it here a bit. So we get our,

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:29.450
if statements then down
here at the bottom of this,

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:32.610
I'm going to print the price so
we can see what it evaluates to.

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:36.530
Let's go ahead and run our code and let's
order some. Oh let's over our lattes.

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:41.000
Take eight lattes. Cool. So it
print did nine. Is that true? Yes.

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:44.160
It totally worked. So that's one way
to do it. We can have it go. Hey,

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:47.120
is it a frappuccino set the price to
this then it'll keep going in order.

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:50.720
Is it black coffee? If it's not,
it'll just skip it. If it is. Oh cool.

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:53.840
Set the price to this. Now notice
these are not nested. If statements,

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:57.280
if we had tried that well
then that totally would not
have worked because if we

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.160
did a nested statement under
like the first one, and we said,

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:03.520
if order equals black coffee,
well then whenever code runs here,

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:07.440
it would only run if the order was
black coffee and a frappuccino.

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:11.120
And that makes zero sense. Now also
earlier I told you that I'd explain this.

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:15.470
Um, I had it to where the L statement
was gonna set the price to $8.

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:17.950
So let's say, for example, over
here in my latte, if I, uh,

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:21.670
add the L statement back in
there, price equals eight,

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:24.390
let's run the code and let's see,
I wanted a frappuccino. Well,

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:25.570
that's interesting.

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:28.910
The price is eight when it should be 13
because you know what happened? Well,

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:31.550
it came in and said, oh yeah
dude, it's totally a frappuccino.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:32.910
We're gonna set the price to 13.

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:36.660
And then it goes through and evaluates
each if statement and when it got down

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:41.460
here, it goes, is it a latte? No.
Well else we're gonna set it to eight.

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:45.540
So that totally wouldn't work now a
different way to do this a better way.

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:48.620
This is a new concept. It's so
cool. We've got if and we got else.

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:53.300
So if that's true, cool else do something
else. But now we also have else.

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:58.970
If legit it's a, it's a thing
else. If or short it's EIF,

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:01.850
it sounds like I'm making up words.
Right. But it's real and it's true.

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:05.010
And a check it out. It's awesome. So
instead of doing a cajillion individual,

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:06.730
if statements let's try EIF,

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:10.210
so I'm gonna step back here and delete
all the stuff up to frappuccino.

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:13.370
So if order equals frappuccino set
the price of 13, just under that,

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:16.760
I'm gonna hit it, enter and then
spacing, keeping that in mind.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.280
Spacing's important shift
tab where I'm equal with,

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:24.240
if I'm gonna type in
Eiff and then just after

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:25.360
EIF, I'll say order

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:33.080
equals black coffee,
colon price equals three.

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:36.310
Now we'll just happen to here is so
powerful. So first you're saying, Hey,

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:40.270
does the order equal frappuccino? If
it does cool, make the price 13 bucks,

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:45.310
then it's like else, but hold on.
If else, if it equals black coffee,

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:48.190
well then Hey, let's go ahead and
set it to $3. So in this case,

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:50.230
in this example, we're not nesting
anything. Just keep in mind.

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:52.870
It's the spacing's important.
It's unequal footing with the, uh,

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:56.140
if it's kinda like a variation on else,
except we're evaluating something else.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.220
That's confusing. I know.

00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:00.500
And we're not saying that the order
has to both equal frappuccino and black

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:03.900
coffee. We're saying, Hey, if it's
frappuccino, cool, do this. If not, Hey,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.140
is it black coffee? Cool. Do this. And
we can keep going. Let's try it out.

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:12.300
Let's add another EIF. Cuz you can
do that. Hit enter after price.

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:14.460
We'll step back to be
equal with EIF. Again,

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.850
EIF order equals espresso.

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:22.010
We'll do our colon enter and keeping our
spacing in mind. We'll do price equals.

00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:25.010
What did we say before? Was it five?
I think it was $5. And tell you what?

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:27.730
Go ahead right now without watching
me go ahead and fill in the rest.

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:32.170
Pause the video now. UN pause.
I'll do mine real quick.

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:35.850
So now we get all our ifs going
on and then we get our E lifts.

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:39.640
Let's run the code. Let's see what
happens. Woohoo run. I would like a,

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:43.520
let's get a latte. I'll have 10 lattes.
It worked. Notice the last number.

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:45.400
There is our price. We're
printing the price down here.

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:47.920
That's the last thing our code
runs and it matches that number.

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:50.160
The logic is working.
We're controlling the flow.

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:53.960
Don't you feel powerful right now. Take
a coffee break. Now also just for fun.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.720
Let's at the very end of
this entire parade here.

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:58.880
Isn't this much cleaner
than a bunch of statements.

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:02.160
I think it is anyway at the end of this,
let's do our else and we'll do print.

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:07.440
Sorry we don't have that here because
we've included all the things they could

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:11.230
order. If they say anything else,
we'll just say no, we don't have that.

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:15.910
Let's try it. Let's run the coat
run. I would like a green tea. Oh,

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:18.670
come on. Where are you at here?
And this logic kind of faulty,

00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:21.470
but I'll just put an eight. Oh, you
know what? We made a mistake. I,

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:24.070
I hope this. I love when, when things
like this happen when I'm teaching,

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:27.310
cuz it's like, well, first of all,
I'm not perfect far from it. What?

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:29.510
It gives you a chance to learn? Like
what do we do here? What's the problem?

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:31.860
Well, first I notice the,
the big glaring problem.

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:37.100
I did you lift price down here, like an
idiot. That should be what it should be.

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:40.420
Order fixed. No harm done. That's not the
main problem. If I run the code again,

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:43.700
I'll say again, green tea.
Uh, we still have a problem.

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:47.300
And it tells us right here in the
air name, error price is not defined.

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:49.740
We're trying to print the price
down here, but it's not there.

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:50.380
It's what I can do.

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:54.050
I could either just call print price
so it doesn't try to run that code.

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:59.010
Or I can just end this L
statement, say price equals zero.

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.970
That way we don't have a problem
anymore. So let's run the code green tea.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:05.170
I'll take nine of them. And I says,
sorry, we don't have that here.

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:09.170
So in that code, we have our, if
your orders, this, do this else.

00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:13.280
If else, if I crazy else, if,

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:17.160
and then finally else, we don't have
that. What are you even doing here?

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.480
This is a coffee shop now
that's it for the new concepts.

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:22.360
But I do have a challenge lab
for you. If you wanna try it out.

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:24.800
The link for that and the walkthrough
will be in the description below.

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:26.840
If you're watching this on YouTube. So
here's a challenge I want you to do.

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:31.760
This will be a fun one. If they order a
latte and they want extra whipped cream,

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:34.630
this is pretty latte. Do
you want whipped cream?

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:37.350
Which of course they're going to want
whipped cream. If the answer is yes,

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:41.870
make the price $11. If no. Well,
keep it at the standard price.

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:43.180
Nine bucks.

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:47.150
This particular problem will
combine everything you've
learned in this video and

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:49.790
previous stuff. So again, check that link
below and see what you got. All right.

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:54.580
That's it for Python right now.
Episode five, coffee Brook. I told you,

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:58.460
I told you I warned you. Python
gets crazy. Awesome. And again,

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.980
that's gonna get even more crazier
and OER. So buckle your seatbelt.

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:03.540
Make sure you have coffee on hand.

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:06.220
And also have you hacked
the YouTube algorithm today?

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:09.380
Let's make sure you do hit the

all those things because you have to
hack YouTube today at the, of course,

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:18.010
and also a massive shout out to the
sponsor of this entire series. It pro TV.

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:21.770
