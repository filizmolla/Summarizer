00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.800
We're about to use one of the most
powerful and fun concepts in Python.

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.000
And we're gonna use that
power to prevent Ben evil Ben

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.120
from entering our coffee shop. Cuz we
don't want Ben here. Get outta here. Ben.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:14.413
You know who you are.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.630
This is episode four of Python
right now my free Python course,

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.590
where I'm gonna teach you pretty much
everything you need to know to become

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.430
amazing and awesome and dangerous in
Python. So yeah. Get your coffee. Ready?

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.150
Get your French press. Get your
coffee pot. We're gonna dive in here.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.430
And our first task will be preventing
evil. Ben from entering our coffee shop.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.060
We're kind of putting in
a robot bouncer barista.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.180
Now just like episodes one through three
and pretty much this entire course,

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.820
she won't need a dang thing
to do this tutorial. Nothing.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.740
I'll provide a lab for you inside your
browser. Check it out. Link below.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.500
It's so cool. And yeah, you're
gonna be doing this hands on.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.460
You're gonna be following along with me
on this because that's the only way to

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.860
learn Python and programming in
general. Pretty much anything in it.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.610
Hands on LABA. Actually. Hold on.
I take that back. I said nothing,

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.010
but you actually do need the
most important ingredients
in anything in it and

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.730
that's coffee because everything
in it requires delicious coffee.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.130
Never Chuck coffee. I'll put it
this way. If you drink some coffee,

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.610
you can continue else leave and go
make some coffee. Then come back.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.410
You'll get that here in a bit.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.400
Now you're probably watching this
episode and wondering, Hey, oh,

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:25.360
where's the rest of it?

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.520
Why is Chuck producing this course
so slow and you're right. I'm sorry.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.760
Cause I know you wanna go
deeper into Python right now.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.560
You don't wanna wait for
me and you shouldn't.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.440
So check out the sponsor of this video
in this entire series. It pro TV,

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.960
it pro TV is the best it
training platform out there.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.160
They are what I use to train in it.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.270
So if you wanna dive deeper into
Python right now, cuz you should,

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.510
they've got you covered
with some amazing courses.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.750
Hands on Python for networking
professionals. Super cool. By the way,

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.870
you gotta try that one out.
Enter to Python programming.
A great starter course.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.830
Ooh, check this one out. Python for
security. What is that? Okay. Yeah,

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.270
this is pretty cool. You
can create your own network.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.940
Port scanner with Python basically
create your own hacking tool.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.620
That's amazing and they
don't just have Python.

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:06.980
They have pretty much everything.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.300
You need to start your it career
and then advance your it career.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.940
They got to cover from the comp
T a plus to my personal favorite,

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.500
the Cisco CCNA. So if you're
tired of messing around,

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.300
you actually want to accelerate your
career or change your career into it.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.970
Now's the time. Check out it pro TV.
And if you use my link below or network,

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.330
Chuck, you get 30% off. Hold on

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.250
forever. So if you wanna study like
me, check him out, link below. Okay.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.050
Let's talk about Ben evil.
Ben, this guy's nasty evil.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.050
Ben hates coffee and he hates
it. He hates technology.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.840
We can't have this guy in our coffee
shop. Here's what we gotta do.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.920
We gotta program a robot barista bouncer
to prevent him from coming into our

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.520
coffee shop. So here's a
logic I wanna say, Hey,

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.800
if Ben comes in a guy named Ben,
so sorry, all Ben's out there,

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.160
it's unfortunate that your name
is Ben, but what are you gonna do?

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.000
If Ben comes in, we want our robot barista
bouncer to say, Hey, get outta here.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.320
We don't want your kind here. And if
their name isn't Ben, then they're cool.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.480
They can come in. They can have some
coffee and we'll let them continue on.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.800
And this is the powerful stuff
we're learning in this video.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.120
We can change what our programs do
based on certain things that happen.

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.630
If Ben comes in, do something
different. That's cool.

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.830
So go ahead and fire up
your Python lab. Again,

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.350
this lab is completely free right here
on your browser or can even be on your

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.690
phone.

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.470
So check that link below and get signed
up and let's keep going and go ahead and

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.830
fire up the first episode four lab. Okay,

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.390
here we are in our Python lab
should look just like this.

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.910
And this might look familiar. This
is the beginning of our robot brief,

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.060
a script that we worked
on in previous episodes.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.180
And now somewhere in here we wanna
program a robot barista bouncer.

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.300
Where do you think we should
put him keeping in mind
that first we have to learn

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.220
the name of the person entering. So if
they are Ben and we're like, get here,

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.580
Ben. So where do you think you should go?

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.620
I think you should go right around
here right after we ask, Hey,

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.980
what's your name? Let's put some space
there. Now we're gonna start with this.

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.850
Tell hype in if and space.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.570
This is a huge concept, which it may not
seem like much. It's just two letters,

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:07.400
but it's huge.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.410
It's referred to as an if statement
and let me show you what it does.

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.810
Check this out. We'll say
if name, the variable name,

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.770
which we're pulling from right here, this
particular line of code is gonna say,

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:19.370
Hey, what's your name? And
the person will answer.

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.000
And it stored inside that
variable name. So if Ben comes in,

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.640
that name will equal Ben, and then
we'll add this. If name equals equals,

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.440
and we'll do a string Ben colon
and we'll stop there, right?

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.520
I, I don't wanna keep going.
Here's what's happening.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.040
What we're saying here is if the
variable name equals these string, Ben,

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.630
that I want you to do something,
do something different.

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.310
So go ahead and put your cursor right
after that colon head enter and we're

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.950
gonna do something. Let's just
say print and we'll print out.

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:56.510
You're not welcome here.
Evil, Ben, get out.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.860
That should do it. Now. There's a
lot going on, but just real quick,

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.860
let's run the code. So at the top, we'll
click on run. Our script's gonna run.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:05.780
It's gonna ask me my name.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.460
I wanna test the first and say my name
is Chuck to avoid the yelling. Okay,

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.940
cool. Just says, hello, Chuck. Thank
you for coming in today. Awesome.

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.500
Let's run it again. Let's see what
happened this time. My name's Ben. Ah,

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.380
I yelled at myself. You're not
welcome here. Evil, Ben, get out now.

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.290
I know it seems like we're a bit bipolar
here because we're like get outta here.

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.050
But then we're like, hello, Ben, thank
you for coming in today. We'll fix that.

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.290
Now. If statements are powerfully simple,

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:34.650
all we're doing here is saying if
whatever comes after it is true,

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.090
then do something. That's all we're doing.

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.090
So if the variable name does
indeed equally string men,

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.560
then do whatever we say after of that.
Now do you wanna see something else?

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.000
Powerful. Watch this. We're gonna add
one more little building block to this.

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.920
So right now we're saying if this
statement is true, do something,

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.960
but we can also make it do something.
If that statement is false,

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:58.920
watch this new concept time. I'm going
to hit enter and do this with me. Enter.

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:03.880
Then I'll do shift tab to step back to
where my cursor right in line with the if

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.440
and I'll type in else,
colon and then enter.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.440
And what I'll put there is I'll actually
take my other print function down here.

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:14.400
Just control X to cut that
and paste that right here.

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:19.430
So now do you see what's happen? Oh, so
powerful. So now if your name has Ben,

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:23.830
if this does evaluate to true
bam, we're gonna kick you out.

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.830
You can't come in here, Ben,
but if your name isn't Ben,

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:31.350
if this does evaluate to false,
then we'll do something else,

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:35.110
else. And that's the
logic. If this is true,

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.780
do this else do that kinda cool. Right?

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.460
And we actually just fixed our issue
that we had up here being bipolar.

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:45.820
We're like, Hey Ben, don't come in
here. I hate you by the way, come in.

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.020
I love you. Like that's really
confusing, but we fixed it.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:52.860
Let's run the code run. What's my name?
My name is Ben evil. Ben, look at Ben.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.540
You're not welcome
here. Evil Ben, get out.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.820
And it just said that
it didn't welcome me.

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:01.930
Then if I run the code again and
I'm not Ben, I'm Patricia, a nice,

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:03.730
friendly greeting. Is it that powerful?

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:06.410
How cool is that to of
all the things you can do.

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:07.890
And we'll talk about that here in a bit,

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.530
but first let's pop the hood a
little bit on how this is working.

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:13.210
Notice our spacing, for
example, notice right after our,

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:16.490
if statement the thing we want to happen,
if this does evaluate the being true,

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.240
it's dented, it's got space right
here. And the notice the else,

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:26.160
what else will happen is not
indented. It's on the same line as if,

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:31.360
but then what we want to happen else.
What else is indented after that?

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:35.160
This is a key Python concept. Cuz
Python does care about your spacing.

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:39.030
It will change how it evaluate your
code, or it might just do give up and,

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:41.430
and in an error saying, Hey, I don't
understand what you're saying to me,

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:44.870
whereas you're spacing. So for example,
if we did not use any good spacing here,

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:48.350
if I were to go in here and do this
with me, we'll see the error together.

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:53.190
If I step that back and do the same thing
to else run the code. It's like, whoa,

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:56.510
whoa, whoa, ah, we don't
like that. Indentation error,

00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:58.910
an unexpected and dented block.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.220
But thankfully when we're
using code editors like this,

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:04.500
they make it easy for us to kind of
know when we have to do some spacing.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:08.740
So let's go ahead and comment out all
the code in this editor right now,

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:12.460
just so we can cleanly play with some
stuff and give you a good chance to

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:14.860
practice your commenting out that way.

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:17.740
When we run this nothing runs and
we have plenty of room to play.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:22.170
So just below all this
mess, let's practice our, if
statements. So I'll type in.

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:23.250
If, and again,

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:26.690
I love code editors cuz notice as soon
as it became an if like right now,

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:29.210
it's I it's just white text, but bam,

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:32.770
if is something else and the code
editor knows that. And at this moment,

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:36.170
it's waiting for us to give it a
statement to evaluate. So I'll try this.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.170
Another new concept. If four,

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:43.520
the number four and an
integer is greater than three

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:47.880
colon. I've got a greater than sign.
We'll talk about that here in a second.

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.800
Let's keep practicing. So
the colon means we're done.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:53.560
If we enter after the colon, bam
already indented, which is nice.

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:57.480
And then we'll just print
out. Yep. It's true.

00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:59.720
And then right here at the
end of our print function,

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:03.840
head enter and we can still do more
stuff. We could do more print functions.

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:06.320
Let's actually gotta do
that. It's still true.

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:09.240
As long as our code is still
indented underneath this,

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:13.120
if statement it'll only run, if this
is true. So if we run that code,

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.750
just do it, do it right now.
It's true. Yes. It's still true.

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:19.790
And most practice are L statement just
after the second print statement will

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:21.630
hit, enter and notice is
still like saying, Hey,

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:24.350
do you still wanna write some code? If
this is true? We'll say, nah, nah, nah,

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:28.510
we'll do shift and tab to step back and
we'll type in else and notice how it

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:31.630
changes color. It's expecting that.
That's good. It works. We don't need it,

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:32.463
but we can do it.

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:35.780
And then we'll hit enter once more to
do something else will print. Nope,

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:40.620
not true. Now. Real quick, little
small challenge for you. Not crazy.

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:43.700
Make it to where this
is a false statement.

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:47.700
Just change the if statement real quick,
it shouldn't be too crazy. I mean,

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:49.780
all you have to do is this.
So go ahead and follow along.

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:52.860
I'll say if two is greater
than three, which you know,

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:57.010
two is obviously not greater than three.
Then that statement evaluate to false.

00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:01.330
Let's run the code. Bam. Nope, not
true. So we got the spacing down.

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:04.010
Now let's talk about the
greater than symbol right here,

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:07.930
which is also known as a
comparison operator. Big words.

00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:11.370
You may recognize these from math. I
told you we weren't done with math,

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:13.050
but Python, math is fun. Remember?

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:17.440
And you'll see all the fan favorites we
got our greater than are less than are

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:21.160
less than or equal to and are.
Oh wait, I wrote that twice.

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:23.520
Let me change that to look,
make it look like, uh,

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.800
greater than you thought you almost
had me. I didn't make a mistake.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.800
I fixed it greater than or equal to
oh, almost forgot. There is one more.

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:33.400
It was up here when we used it with Ben
what's with the two equal signs. Well,

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:38.030
you may recall that when we define
a variable and Python, for example,

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:41.910
if I define the variable
me equal to network,

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:46.390
Chuck notice I'm using only one
equal sign with one equal sign.

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:49.190
We're setting the variable
me equal to network Chuck.

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:53.560
But if we throw in a second
equal sign, not plus sign equal.

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:58.590
What we're now telling you
to do is evaluate if the
variable is already equal to

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:01.030
network Chuck, if it
is, it will return true.

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:04.310
And if it isn't it'll return false. I
don't know what happened to my true.

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:07.750
I need to fix that. That looks ugly. There
we go. That's better now. Quick quiz.

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:10.230
What do you think will happen when I
run this code? Will I get an error?

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:13.710
If you thought so then that's the case.
Watch this run the code. It's like,

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:16.910
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. That me
variable. It's not even defined.

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:19.380
You're trying to say it. Is it equal
to network Chuck? And it's like,

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:22.380
it's not equal to anything. You haven't
even defined the me variable. All right.

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:26.980
Quick coffee break. Cuz that was
a lot. I know. Here we go. Mm.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.580
And one more thing. And
then a challenge lab.

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:30.740
Let's go ahead and dive in real quick.

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.260
Now go ahead and open
lab two for episode four.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:37.820
And you'll notice that we already
have our bouncer barista robot or our

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.050
barista bouncer in there. Here's the code.

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:43.450
If evil Ben comes in BA we got
get outta here, Ben. But no,

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:46.090
I want you to notice one thing about
this and this is a new concept here.

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:49.450
Let's run the code. Let's run it.
What's your name? Let's say I am evil.

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:51.690
Ben evil Ben coming in hot notice.

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:56.160
It tells me you're not welcome here,
Ben get out. But then it's like,

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:58.400
let's just continue. What kind
of coffee do you want? Ben?

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:01.600
It's still a little
confusing. How do we fix that?

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:03.760
See if you can do it real quick now, hint,

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:06.560
it's not gonna be an overhaul
of the entire script,

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:09.040
but lemme see if you can get
this and, and you can Google it.

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.240
Feel free to Google real quick
and figure this out. All right,

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:13.590
welcome back now had
been inclined to go, oh,

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:15.350
well the last time we hit this issue,

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:19.950
let me stop a script is we just kept
adding everything we wanna do in the L

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:23.990
statement. Like, okay, well if
Ben's here, kick him out else.

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.870
Let's continue the
script we could do that.

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:29.070
We could nest all of this
remaining script under the ELs,

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:31.150
but that's kind of messy,
right? We don't wanna do that.

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:33.300
We had all this hard work,
making all this look pretty.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.180
So as I mentioned before,

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:36.180
you can do things in a lot of
different ways in programming.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.300
One way is after we evaluate the,

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:42.460
the name does indeed equal bend and we
yell at 'em we'll hit enter right after

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:46.740
that print statement and then
type in exit and parentheses.

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:47.860
What we're saying here is say, Hey,

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:52.620
if N Eagles bend parent this up
and then stop exit the program.

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:56.810
We're here. Let's try it out.
Click on run. What's your name?

00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:01.370
My name's Ben and bam. The
script is done. Sorry, Ben,

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:03.610
you can't have coffee in here. Whew. Okay.

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:07.930
That was controlling the flow of your
Python programming and that's just the

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:08.250
beginning.

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:11.330
Like we have a lot more to cover with
that and it gets more insane and more fun.

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:13.930
Now, as I mentioned before,
I've got two additional channel,

00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:17.400
just two additional labs that you can go
through and test your knowledge and get

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:19.680
better at this. So link
below, go through that.

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.840
I'll even have a video walk
through, so check it out.

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:23.360
So if you enjoyed this video,

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.840
make sure you hack that YouTube algorithm
hit that like button notification,

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:30.640
bell comment, subscribe, gotta hack
YouTube today. Ethically of course else,

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:35.390
those along your statement
else. Uh, print I'm a E exit.

00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:38.190
I don't know. I don't know
where I was going with that,

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:41.670
but that's it for episode
four, controlling our flow
of our code and Python,

00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:46.670
if else, comparison operators. And like
I said before, it only gets crazier.

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:49.030
And also thanks again to
our sponsor it pro TV.
