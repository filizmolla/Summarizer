00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:00.943
- Warning!

00:00:00.943 --> 00:00:04.660
We are about to use Python
to destroy, obliterate data.

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.650
Please try this at home, in your lab,

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:07.800
like not in production.

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.222
(mellow music)

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.400
No, yeah, I'm being a bit dramatic,

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.350
big surprise, but
seriously, in this video,

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.160
we're gonna level up once
more, our Python skills,

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.180
more specifically lists,
and we're going to

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.470
learn how to obliterate,
destroy Python data

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.820
but really we're just
removing stuff from a list.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.310
So, just that.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.720
But it's still pretty cool
and a crazy valuable skill.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.680
Quick coffee break before we start.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.340
And if you haven't already,
check that link below

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.670
to launch our free Python
lab for this episode.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.410
Seriously, it's a free
Python lab right here

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.243
in your browser.

00:00:41.243 --> 00:00:42.690
Go click it, like now.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.523
It's free.

00:00:43.523 --> 00:00:44.356
And while it's loading,

00:00:44.356 --> 00:00:45.850
can I show you something
I've been working on?

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:46.683
Check this out.

00:00:46.683 --> 00:00:47.620
Here in the Hands On Python

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.970
for Networking Professionals
course on IT Pro TV.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.610
I am learning how to build
my own subnet calculator

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.690
because all of us kind
of suck at subnetting.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:56.980
See that series right here.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.170
But if you suck less at
Python, you can become awesome

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.170
at subnetting by building

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.840
your own subnet calculator in Python.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.087
How cool is this?

00:01:04.087 --> 00:01:05.700
Ah, and speaking of IT Pro TV,

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.530
they are the sponsor of this entire series

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.530
and the reason it can
be free here on YouTube.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.810
And they are my choice for IT training.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.020
They are what I use to
learn stuff obviously.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.740
And pretty much whatever
you wanna learn in IT,

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.410
they have you covered
from just getting started

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.730
with the A Plus to their latest courses,

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.260
like Windows Terminal
Skills, PowerShell Skills,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.640
Hands-on Web App Testing.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.450
They're constantly adding
stuff to their library

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.040
and that's why I continue to
watch them to learn new stuff.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.610
And there's an added feature
to where you don't fall asleep

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.720
when you watch their videos,
which I think is pretty cool.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.120
So anyways, check them out.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.350
They've got virtual labs,
they've got practice tests.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.580
They've got everything you
need to become awesome in IT.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:39.413
Did that rhyme?

00:01:39.413 --> 00:01:40.246
Kind of, a little bit.

00:01:40.246 --> 00:01:41.079
I'm gonna go with it.

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:42.000
So check them out, link below.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.090
ITpro.tv/networkChuck.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.753
And if you use the code
networkChuck, you get 30% off,

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:49.630
forever.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.260
So in case you're new here,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.170
you and me, we're going camping.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.507
You're coming, I'm making you come.

00:01:54.507 --> 00:01:56.770
And in the last few videos
we've been putting together

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.340
our camping supplies list,

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.200
and you almost got us in trouble,
because we almost forgot,

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.430
and when I say we, I
mean you, toilet paper

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:04.590
and for me, a bidet.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.000
But thankfully we were
able to add those supplies

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.960
with some methods, but
we got a bit overzealous.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.620
We packed too much.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.890
You see I'm taking my Tesla

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.230
because it's a Tesla and we
can't fit everything inside.

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.430
So, now we have to remove
things from our list.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:20.520
Now I know what you're probably thinking.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.540
Well, Chuck removing things
from a list is pretty easy.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.140
Just go in here and start deleting.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.080
No, yeah, I can't do that.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.980
That's lazy.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.450
We're gonna do it programmatically
with Python and skills.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:29.283
Okay?

00:02:29.283 --> 00:02:30.238
Okay?

00:02:30.238 --> 00:02:31.330
Sorry. I feel like very
aggressive in this video.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:32.163
Must be all the coffee.

00:02:32.163 --> 00:02:32.996
It's okay.

00:02:32.996 --> 00:02:33.950
It is one of the side effects.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.290
So here's our task.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.210
We have to remove some
non-essential items from our list.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.350
Now we could remove the
raspberry pi or ethernet cable

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.960
but no, too essential

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.000
so we can take away our
tent and sleeping bags.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.900
Yes, that's what we'll do.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.760
So, remove tent and sleeping
bags from our list with Python.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.340
Now, just like we used a method
to add stuff to our list.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.090
We'll also use a method to
remove things from our list.

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.290
So let's try this out.

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.380
The code we have right here.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.540
Go ahead and run it and sure it works.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:00.373
Cool.

00:03:00.373 --> 00:03:01.990
All our supplies are
right here in the console.

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.010
Now just after we added
toilet paper and bidet,

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.530
let's go and do this, type this with me.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.240
Supplies, our supplies list.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.670
And then do dot clear the method
clear and then parentheses.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.370
Oh not nine, parentheses.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.280
Easy enough right?

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.230
Let's run the code.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:21.770
What did you do?

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:23.110
The data, it's not there.

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.943
It's gone.

00:03:23.943 --> 00:03:25.040
I told you just to delete two things

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.390
and now the whole thing's gone.

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:27.470
It's okay.

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:28.600
I know it was a bit nuclear

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.880
but I wanted to show you this one first.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:30.840
It's just more fun.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.290
So, if you wanna take out your entire list

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.660
just for some reason, you
can use the clear option,

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.260
the clear method, and it will do the job.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.574
So clear is nuclear and notice up here,

00:03:40.574 --> 00:03:43.800
it actually printed a
list with nothing inside

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.366
which actually brings
up a really cool point.

00:03:45.366 --> 00:03:49.830
You can have empty lists,
which seems pointless, right?

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.250
But no, but it does come in handy

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.600
when you're programmatically
adding things to a list

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.090
but you don't have anything for
that list to have in it yet.

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.260
That was a really awkward
way of saying that.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.530
But essentially what
you might end up doing

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.860
is defining a list like this
and that sucker's empty.

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.110
And then later on in your script

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:04.220
when you're doing something really cool,

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.200
which we will do later.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.110
I can't show you it yet

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.780
but you'll start adding stuff to your list

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.300
using those methods we talked about.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.310
So yes, lists can be empty.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.520
Little fun fact for you.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.180
So anyways, clear is cool

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.900
but we may not want to
eliminate everything.

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:18.733
So let's take that out.

00:04:18.733 --> 00:04:20.000
A bit overzealous today, aren't we?

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.130
So, now let's try the most
intuitive method out there.

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:23.470
If you wanna remove
something from your list,

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.850
you might want to use the remove method

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.313
and that's what we're gonna do, remove.

00:04:27.313 --> 00:04:30.310
So dot remove the color
changes, things change.

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.270
I love it.

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.910
Parentheses and then
here, how do we specify

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.640
what piece of data to remove?

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.700
We just simply call out that value.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.060
So for example, removing
our tent and sleeping bags.

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.390
So let's try tent, that's it?

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:43.340
Then click run.

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.100
It's gone, no tent here.

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.160
Now one key thing to note
with the remove method

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.930
is that when we wanna remove something,

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.740
we specify the actual value,
the actual name of the data.

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.080
And obviously it has to be correct.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.410
'Cause if you put instead put tents,

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.870
we're gonna get an error
'cause tents aren't there.

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:59.703
It's just tent.

00:04:59.703 --> 00:05:01.940
So real quick, why don't you
try and remove sleeping bags.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.200
Go ahead and add that code for
us so I don't have to do it.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.033
Pause the video.

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:06.773
Unpause.

00:05:06.773 --> 00:05:07.606
Okay, coffee break.

00:05:07.606 --> 00:05:08.439
Here's how I would do it.

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:10.510
We'll do another remove method here.

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.510
Supplies dot remove and
same story as earlier,

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.090
parentheses, specify our data
which will be sleeping bags.

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:18.270
Just how it looks up there.

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:19.630
Now, if we run our code, bam,

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.430
tent and sleeping bags are gone.

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:22.990
Hey, you know, we kind
of just already did it.

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.950
Our Tesla is lighter.

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:24.783
We can get there.

00:05:24.783 --> 00:05:25.616
It's fine.

00:05:25.616 --> 00:05:26.449
Now notice this.

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:30.500
We can only remove one piece
of data with our remove method

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.540
which is important to remember,

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:32.560
'cause you may have tried this.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.070
You may have tried to go, hey,

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.271
if I can just put a comma
there and put in tent,

00:05:37.271 --> 00:05:39.720
it might work, but it
won't, you'll get an error.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.200
Watch, error.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.310
Now how to remove
multiple items from a list

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.330
is not the simplest thing to do.

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.720
And it'll be a concept to
cover later on on this course.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.000
Now you probably assume this by now

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.860
but there's more than one way
to remove an item from a list.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.420
Yeah, we have a remove
method and he's pretty great.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.450
And instead of using the
value to remove stuff,

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:59.120
we'll use the index, which
is very handy and you know

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.930
this new method also has a cool feature

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:01.990
that you probably don't care about

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:03.010
but you'll care about it when I show you.

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.160
Okay, I, let me just show it to you, okay?

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.410
So let's remove our
remove methods real quick.

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:08.243
Just take 'em all out.

00:06:08.243 --> 00:06:09.076
Obliterate.

00:06:09.076 --> 00:06:09.909
Same story as before.

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:13.600
Let's type our supplies list dot

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.530
and then here comes the fun one type in

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:16.700
pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:17.533
That's what it is.

00:06:17.533 --> 00:06:18.500
That's the method, it's called pop.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.630
That's kind of a fun one, right?

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:20.900
And then parentheses.

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.930
And now I mentioned, yes,

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:26.040
we're gonna use an
index to remove our data

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.180
instead of the value.

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.703
So, I want you to do this by yourself.

00:06:29.703 --> 00:06:33.140
Knowing how indexes work
and how pop probably works,

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:36.130
try and remove our tent and
sleeping bags from the list.

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:37.970
Pause the video, go.

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:39.030
Unpause, coffee break.

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:41.801
With my first pop method
statement here, whatever,

00:06:41.801 --> 00:06:43.530
I'm gonna remove tent.

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:47.150
And I know the index of tent
is going to be the zero.

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:48.256
Cool.

00:06:48.256 --> 00:06:49.089
(keys tap)

00:06:49.089 --> 00:06:50.056
That should do it.

00:06:50.056 --> 00:06:50.889
Actually, let's run the
code and make sure it works.

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:51.722
Tent is gone.

00:06:51.722 --> 00:06:52.820
Awesome.

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:53.653
I'm gonna do the same thing down here.

00:06:53.653 --> 00:06:55.940
Supplies dot pop.

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.280
And I'll remove and actually
this is kind of interesting

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.340
because I didn't realize
this as I was doing it.

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.040
I'm gonna do zero here.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:03.899
What?

00:07:03.899 --> 00:07:05.210
Watch, watch.

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:06.430
I bet you it is gonna work.

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:07.556
Run, totally worked.

00:07:07.556 --> 00:07:09.880
So tent and sleeping bags are gone

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.121
but why did you use zero twice?

00:07:11.121 --> 00:07:14.870
Well, because when I removed
pop, the index changed, right?

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:16.810
That required a bit of
critical thinking, didn't it?

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:18.250
It was kind of fun though
it was like a puzzle.

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:20.900
So the first pop method, we removed tent.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:25.080
So the zero index tent obliterated.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.870
Now, after that happened,

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:29.280
sleeping bags was in the zero index

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.194
and we're like, okay, now we
wanna take out sleeping bags.

00:07:31.194 --> 00:07:34.060
It's not gonna be one like
you might have thought,

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:35.000
it's gonna be zero.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:35.833
That's kind of fun.

00:07:35.833 --> 00:07:36.730
That's kinda a little fun puzzle.

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:37.930
If you got that right, let me know.

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:40.050
And also keep in mind how
your indexes will change

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:42.570
if you use multiple indexes,
indices, how do you say that?

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:43.403
I don't know.

00:07:43.403 --> 00:07:45.460
Now pop is pretty cool because
of the way it removes stuff

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:48.080
by indexes, but it does
something else cool.

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:49.455
It has a little hidden feature.

00:07:49.455 --> 00:07:52.120
When you remove something
with pop it not only just,

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.800
you know, takes it out, it will
also return that same data.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:56.660
What does that mean?

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:57.630
Let's try it out.

00:07:57.630 --> 00:07:58.910
Let's just demonstrate that sucker.

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:00.702
What we're gonna do real quick
is actually just surround

00:08:00.702 --> 00:08:04.060
that supplies dot pop zero
with a print statement.

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:04.893
Let's do that.

00:08:04.893 --> 00:08:07.110
So we'll print open parenthesis
and then closing parenthesis

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:08.120
over here at the end.

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:12.410
So, now we're gonna print the
return of this program here,

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:13.290
this little script.

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:14.290
Let's try it out, run.

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:15.396
Did you see that?

00:08:15.396 --> 00:08:17.908
Look at that up here before
we printed the entire list

00:08:17.908 --> 00:08:20.160
it just printed tent
because the pop method

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.740
will return that data that we're deleting,

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:22.573
which is kind of cool.

00:08:22.573 --> 00:08:23.770
It's like a combo move.

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:26.270
Bam, delete, bam, let me
show you what I just deleted.

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:27.340
One, two punch, I love it.

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.750
Now you might be thinking,
well, what's the point of that?

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:30.600
That seems pointless.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:31.663
Well, you might want to, you know

00:08:31.663 --> 00:08:34.240
just have a confirmation of
something you delete, right?

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.073
That's handy.

00:08:35.073 --> 00:08:36.150
So, for example, I might do this.

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:40.297
I'll print this item was just deleted

00:08:40.297 --> 00:08:42.030
and then I'll add that string I just made

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:44.840
to the return of that pop method.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.410
So now if I run the code, run.

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:48.360
I get this nice little output
about something I just did.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.490
This item was just deleted.

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:51.290
It was tent and it was also just deleted.

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:52.123
Like that's cool.

00:08:52.123 --> 00:08:52.956
One, two punch.

00:08:52.956 --> 00:08:54.180
Take yourself a quick coffee break

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:56.360
'cause you just obliterated some data.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.440
We dropped a nuclear bomb
with the clear method,

00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.810
just taking out the entire list.

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:02.730
We then removed one item at
a time with the remove method

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:03.900
but we gotta specify the value

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:06.430
and then we popped one
out using the index.

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:07.263
Pop!

00:09:07.263 --> 00:09:08.760
Which will also return the
data that we just deleted,

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:09.593
which is kind of handy.

00:09:09.593 --> 00:09:10.426
Now there's something weird,

00:09:10.426 --> 00:09:11.900
something that's just like a list,

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:13.167
almost identical to it, but it's faster.

00:09:13.167 --> 00:09:16.070
It's almost better in every way

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:19.396
as far as running programs,
it's something called a tuple.

00:09:19.396 --> 00:09:20.520
What?

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:21.353
Sounds weird.

00:09:21.353 --> 00:09:22.200
Now, if you don't wanna wait,

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.970
I already have this
next episode ready to go

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:26.560
locked and loaded on
Network Chuck Academy.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.310
And if you wanna get some extra practice

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:29.460
with all the stuff we just learned,

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:31.810
because you do need that
practice to cement that knowledge

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:33.900
into your brain, it's
all about repetition.

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:35.370
If you don't use it, you'll lose it.

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:37.020
So check on Network Chuck Academy,

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:39.020
where I've got some extra quizzes and labs

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:41.581
to get yourself practiced up in Python.

00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:42.900
I can't talk anymore.

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:45.461
Oh, and also have you hacked
the YouTube algorithm today?

00:09:45.461 --> 00:09:46.457
Let's make sure you do.

00:09:46.457 --> 00:09:48.731
Hit that like button, notification
bell, comment, subscribe.

00:09:48.731 --> 00:09:50.210
That's it, everything, yeah.

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:51.842
That's right, because you
gotta hack YouTube today.

00:09:51.842 --> 00:09:53.670
Ethically of course.

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:55.330
Yeah, that's pretty much all I have.

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:57.633
I'll catch you guys next time.

00:09:57.633 --> 00:10:00.216
(mellow music)
