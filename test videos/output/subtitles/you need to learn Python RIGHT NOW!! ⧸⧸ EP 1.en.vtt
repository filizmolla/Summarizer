00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.020
You need to learn Python
right now. Hold up. Why? What,

00:00:04.021 --> 00:00:07.140
why do you need to learn Python right
now? The biggest reason right here,

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.140
if you want to get a job in
it or information technology,

00:00:10.141 --> 00:00:12.720
or you want to advance
in your current job, man,

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.620
you've got to know Python or at least
learn it. Soon. Network engineer, Python,

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.930
cloud engineer, Python, ethical
hacker. You guessed it Python.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.840
And honestly, that's my
list. That's my one reason.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.290
Do you need another reason beyond the
fact that Python is just cool and amazing

00:00:28.291 --> 00:00:32.580
and magic? Nah, probably not. So welcome
to episode one of my Python core.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.420
Want to teach you everything you need
to know to become dangerous and Python.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.230
And we're starting from zero. Like I
don't know what the junk Python is. Zero.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.510
No pre-recs. And by
the end of this course,

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.070
my goal is for you to have the skills,

00:00:52.071 --> 00:00:55.670
just to be awesome and Python and
whatever job you have. So yeah.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.880
Get your coffee ready.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.720
We're going to learn some Python and also
a massive shout out to the sponsor of

00:01:02.721 --> 00:01:06.860
this entire series and the reason it
can be free here on YouTube. It pro TV.

00:01:06.861 --> 00:01:10.070
If you want to learn anything in it, they
are my number one choice there. What?

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.670
I used to learn stuff. Cloud hacking
Linux and yeah, you guessed it.

00:01:13.671 --> 00:01:16.610
Python like check out this awesome
Python hacking course they have.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:17.331
So check them out.

00:01:17.331 --> 00:01:21.470
Use my link below or code network Chuck
and get 30% off forever. All right.

00:01:21.471 --> 00:01:24.950
Now let's start learning Python.
So first, what do you need?

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.260
What do you need to start?
Learning Python? Nothing.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.530
You won't need anything to start learning
Python with me in this course. Yeah.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.160
You can install and run Python
on any computer Linux, Mac PC,

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.080
but we're not going to mess with
that because that takes time.

00:01:36.081 --> 00:01:38.120
And we're going to learn Python right now.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.360
I want you to start coding immediately
right here in your browser.

00:01:41.361 --> 00:01:42.410
And that's all it takes it.

00:01:42.411 --> 00:01:46.490
Computer with a browser or heck even
a phone with the browser. Oh, hold on.

00:01:46.491 --> 00:01:49.580
I take that back. You won't need nothing.
You'll need, um, you'll need coffee.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.670
That's required just this. But anyways,
check that link in the description.

00:01:52.671 --> 00:01:55.940
You'll get access to my free Python
lab through my free membership.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.420
So click that link below, get signed
up and let's start coding right now.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.760
Now you'll know you're in the right
place. When you see something like this,

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.490
this will be our Python
environment. Our lab now real quick.

00:02:04.491 --> 00:02:07.760
I want you to click inside here. Just
any line in here. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,

00:02:07.761 --> 00:02:11.210
doesn't matter. And just start
typing. Oh wait. What's going on here.

00:02:11.211 --> 00:02:13.700
You are invited to create
a free replica account.

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.760
Replica is the tool we're going to be
using to do all of this Python stuff.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.310
And if you want to be able to edit
your code and save it, come back to it,

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.580
all kinds of fun stuff. You're going to
want that for account again. It's free.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.190
Don't worry about it. Just do it
real quick. Once you're signed up,

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.900
they'll come back and
things will be great.

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.180
And once you have an account and
you start typing in your editor,

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.240
it'll give you the option to
fork it. Which sounds funny.

00:02:32.241 --> 00:02:35.120
I know which basically means creating
your own version of what I've typed in

00:02:35.121 --> 00:02:37.220
here. Going click that it's fine. Forking.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.180
And now right here in your browser or
your phone or whatever you're using,

00:02:41.181 --> 00:02:42.560
you have a Python lab.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.110
So let's not waste any more
time right here on line three.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.570
Let's just start coding. Just
copy what I do real quick.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.140
We're going to write some code
type in the word, print print,

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.720
and then type in left,
parentheses, quotation, mark.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.180
Notice it's filling in stuff for us as
we're doing that. So it's like magic.

00:02:56.181 --> 00:03:00.940
I'm telling you and the type in
hello world exclamation point

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.270
actually let's do a couple of
those four or five, six or 10.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.090
Cause we're super excited to learn Python
and we're triggering lots of coffee.

00:03:07.091 --> 00:03:08.200
I hope that's your code.

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.730
We're done going click on the play button
up here or the run button and let's

00:03:12.731 --> 00:03:15.910
watch what happens. Run.
Boom. Okay. Hello world.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.600
Down here in our Python terminal,
we just ran Python code. That's it.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.460
We're done. Your code are now. No,
let's talk about what we did here.

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:26.070
So when we said print,
hello world and Python,

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.100
we gave our computer a set of
instructions. We said, Hey computer.

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.820
I want you to do something for me. I
want you to actually say out loud or,

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.110
and the terminal hello world. And of
course he said, okay, I'm doing it.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.480
And boom, hello world. We
basically made him talk.

00:03:39.481 --> 00:03:42.720
But we had to tell him in a language he
understands, which is why we use Python.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.760
Python is a computer programming language.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.280
And while this is a simple
example at the end of the day,

00:03:47.281 --> 00:03:49.500
that's pretty much all we're
doing. When we're using Python,

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.310
we're telling our computer what to
do in a language. He understands now,

00:03:53.311 --> 00:03:56.190
as we go further in this course,
and we go deeper into Python,

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.430
we can tell our computer to do
more advanced things like, Hey,

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.950
go hack this other computer
or go hack this network.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.270
Or we might tell the computer, Hey,

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.780
can you make this configuration change
to all the devices in my network?

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:08.460
And it will automate that really?

00:04:08.461 --> 00:04:11.370
You can do anything with Python
and that's what makes it amazing.

00:04:11.371 --> 00:04:14.070
That's why learning Python is
like learning how to do magic.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.130
So let's keep learning some magic. Let's
take another look at our code here.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.170
So this point we know that when
we said print, hello world,

00:04:19.171 --> 00:04:21.480
we told our computer to say hello world,

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.720
but what's actually going on right
here. Let's break that down. So first,

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.540
what is print? What is
that thing doing in Python?

00:04:27.541 --> 00:04:30.150
This is called a function which
we'll cover more on later.

00:04:30.151 --> 00:04:33.480
Let me show you how to create your own
functions. Just no for now it's code.

00:04:33.481 --> 00:04:34.890
That does stuff. And in our case,

00:04:34.891 --> 00:04:37.890
the stuff that it did was make the
computer talk. And in Python, you know,

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.530
what's a function. When you see
these parentheses right here,

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.350
open and close without the hello
world. It'll look just like this.

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.480
Now this next thing is a huge concept.

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.310
The south in between
and our function here,

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.380
that sucker is what's called a string.

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.890
You are going to use this so much in
Python. So just get this in there.

00:04:52.891 --> 00:04:56.550
Here we go. Coffee break.
Who? Yeah, here we go.

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.630
A string is a sequence of characters
or the way I like to think of it.

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.150
It's just text. So looking
at hello world here,

00:05:03.151 --> 00:05:06.600
we have our characters H
as a character E I mean,

00:05:06.601 --> 00:05:11.100
all of them are w even this space right
here in between is itself a character.

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.400
And when we combine those characters
together in Python, it's called a string.

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.510
Now, how do you know if something is
a string in Python? And he guesses,

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:23.160
you will always see a string with
quotes around just like this.

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.670
Bam, double quotes also be single quotes.

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:29.670
So if it's like a one line from each
side too, you get away, boom, boom,

00:05:29.671 --> 00:05:32.670
just single quotes. That's also
a string you can use either or,

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:36.150
but my personal preference and what I
recommend is to always use double quotes.

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.630
It's just better, but whatever you
pick, just pick it and be consistent.

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.930
And also, do you remember this got a
challenge for you for the next 24 hours?

00:05:42.931 --> 00:05:45.270
Every time you say string,
I want you to quote it.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.250
So string string just do it or don't I

00:05:50.251 --> 00:05:51.780
don't care, but it's a
good way to remember.

00:05:51.781 --> 00:05:55.560
I think let's get back to our lab for a
second. Let's try printing more strings.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.640
So follow along with meals,

00:05:56.641 --> 00:05:59.840
print our ones we'll type in print
using our print function. And this time,

00:05:59.841 --> 00:06:02.480
you know, let's go crazy. Let's
do a single quote, just single.

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:07.250
And we'll say I am iron man. Just like
that. Let's go ahead and run that code.

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.760
I clicking our start button up
here. Our run button run and boom.

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:14.870
We just coded again. Hello world. I
am iron man. Let's keep practicing.

00:06:14.871 --> 00:06:17.320
Let's do another one. Print. No comma.

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.790
I am Tony stark. Let's
do another one France.

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:26.170
Now I have a point to this.
Just follow along. No comma.

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:30.040
I am now let's print that out. Cool.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.790
So we have a lot of print functions,
printing some fun stuff all real quick.

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.550
Just underneath that last
print function, let's do this.

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:41.560
Do a hashtag hashtag insight
bin. We are practicing

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:48.190
Python. It's awesome. Now what just
happened here? Let's try it out.

00:06:48.191 --> 00:06:50.690
Let's run the code. Uh, nothing. Nothing,

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:54.220
nothing happened or nothing happened
differently. Right? New concept time.

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.830
Notice we also have the same
thing up here. The hashtag, Hey,

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.570
there's nothing here. Wake
up. Then we have this.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.810
When you see a hashtag or a pound
sign, we're telling our computer,

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.080
don't read this the same for you,
buddy. This is for humans only.

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:08.050
We're telling our computer to
ignore that line in our code.

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:11.620
This is called a comment. And it's
for us. It's for people. It's for you.

00:07:11.621 --> 00:07:13.750
As you're coding, you can make
notes on what you're doing.

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:14.560
That's for the next code,

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.140
or that comes behind you and tries
to make sense of the crap you coded.

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.900
You can go, oh, that's what he's
doing. Cause he made a comment.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.870
So whenever you add a pound
sign in front of something,

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:26.800
that immediately will comment it
out or just tell the computer.

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.620
Don't look at this. It's not for you,
buddy. That's really handy. When,

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:32.110
for example, I have the
print, hello world. Up here.

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:34.090
This is code the computer
will read and run.

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:36.760
But maybe just for this
next time I run my code.

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:40.570
I don't want that to be included so I can
just put a pound sign or hashtag right

00:07:40.571 --> 00:07:43.630
in front of it. And bam, notice it
changed color. It's being ignored.

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:46.600
Now you've probably noticed this
far, that things change color.

00:07:46.601 --> 00:07:47.890
When we do cool things in here,

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:51.190
this is a Python IDE or an
integrated development environment.

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:54.190
So it's definitely more than a text editor
and it does cool things like that to

00:07:54.191 --> 00:07:57.160
help us code Python. And a lot of
ways, it's like a spellchecker. No,

00:07:57.161 --> 00:07:59.230
when you're typing in Microsoft
word or whatever you're using,

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.600
if you misspell something, it'll
tell you underline it with red,

00:08:01.601 --> 00:08:02.860
kind of the same thing here with coding.

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:04.960
So actually let's try something
real quick. So we know that here,

00:08:04.961 --> 00:08:09.370
when we printed the string, no I
am poppy. We know what the string,

00:08:09.371 --> 00:08:12.100
because there are quotation marks,
but what if we remove those?

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.520
What would happen? Let's try, let's
remove them remove the last one.

00:08:15.521 --> 00:08:18.460
And the first one, it was,
first of all, it changed color.

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:23.290
And then we try to run it.
Watch what happens. Ah,

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:28.060
it's your first big, bad red error,
syntax error, which you're going to,

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:30.760
by the way, get used to cause you're
going to see this a lot. And it's fine.

00:08:30.761 --> 00:08:32.350
If you see it, every programmer sees this.

00:08:32.351 --> 00:08:35.770
Every person who ever starts writing
Python or any kind of code will experience

00:08:35.771 --> 00:08:39.880
this constantly. And you're one Google
away from understanding what this means.

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:41.260
Now here it's like saying, Hey,

00:08:41.261 --> 00:08:45.130
you probably meant to do a string and
you didn't and it's invalid syntax.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:49.000
Add those quotations back in their
sucker so we can run this code problem

00:08:49.001 --> 00:08:52.630
solved. So now you know what
strings are, but what do you say?

00:08:52.631 --> 00:08:56.130
We have some more fun with them.
Let's cover some string basics. Yeah,

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.040
let's do this strings basics.

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:01.620
So we've got a task force to help
us learn these strings basics.

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:05.550
Right now we have three print functions
in our program. I don't like that.

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:08.130
Where I want us to do is get
down to only one print function.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.850
I want us to print this entire thing with
one print function. And not just that.

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:15.660
I want it to look just like this.
Exactly like this each on its own line.

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.100
And there are multiple ways to do this.

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:19.980
So we're going to learn a few things about
strings as we try. Now, first of all,

00:09:19.981 --> 00:09:22.920
if you already have an idea of how to
accomplish this, pause that sucker,

00:09:22.921 --> 00:09:26.220
pause this video and see what you got.
Now. If your first thought was like,

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:29.700
Chuck, this is pretty dang easy.
Instead of doing three separate strings,

00:09:29.701 --> 00:09:33.600
let's just write one big string that
has all this text inside. It's good.

00:09:33.601 --> 00:09:34.920
Thought. Let's try that first.

00:09:34.921 --> 00:09:37.950
I'm gonna comment out all this code so
I can keep it here for reference that

00:09:37.951 --> 00:09:41.670
way. It's not going to be run though.
Come down here and start typing away.

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:46.290
So we'll do our one and only print
function and then our double quotes

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:48.210
and I'll type in white text.

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:52.950
So now we're using one print function
with one string. Let's see what happens.

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:56.690
Let's run our code. Right? Okay, cool.
We did it, but we didn't do it right?

00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:00.140
Because I wanted each of these things
to be on their own line. Right.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:04.410
We might think, well, this is just
text. I know how to add a line in text.

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:08.840
You hit enter after the sentence.
Right? So there and there,

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:11.720
that should do the trick. Right? I am
iron man. I'm Tony stark, non poppy.

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:15.350
Let's see what happens. Oh, good. Old air.

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:18.590
Now you probably noticed
immediately that, uh,

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:21.950
some things change as we change that
Python no longer recognized that this

00:10:21.951 --> 00:10:25.150
entire thing is string it. As soon as,

00:10:25.151 --> 00:10:27.050
since we hit enter to add a line break,

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.450
we were done with the print
function and we just did it wrong.

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:31.310
There is one really easy way to fix this.

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:33.680
You see this right here
is just irregular string,

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:38.450
but there are things called multi
line strings. I'll show you.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.330
We're going to add some extra quotes.
So I'm going to go up to the top here,

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:45.560
right at the beginning of that string.
And I'm going to add two more quotes.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:50.960
So now I have three double quotes. I'm
going do the same thing at the end.

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:52.160
Notice our color did change.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:55.190
So we're back in action there and let's
run our code and see what happens.

00:10:55.970 --> 00:11:00.050
Oh yeah. Look that mission accomplished
this. My friends is a multiline string.

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:04.400
That's exhausting. Three quotation
marks. We'll take care of that for you.

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.770
And we can do whatever we
want inside that string.

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:11.300
We can add a bunch of space. Pretty cool.

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:16.130
So that's one way to accomplish this
in one print function, but that's two.

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:19.160
Nah, I'm going to make it harder
for you for the next challenge.

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:22.100
I don't want you to, to make one
big long string. No, no, no, no.

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:26.210
I want you to keep these individual
strings in one print function again.

00:11:26.211 --> 00:11:29.390
If you already know how to do this, try
it out. Pause the video. If you don't,

00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:30.283
let's do it right now.

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:34.250
So this will start to open your eyes
to the magic of strings and Python.

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:39.140
So once I've been prints type in
my first string, I am iron man.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.450
How do I add another string
to this print function?

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:45.350
One way is to add them together.
I'm going to do a space,

00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:48.200
a plus sign, because that's what
you do. When you add things,

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:52.850
you use a plus sign. Python
is no different. And I'll
put in my next string. No,

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:58.030
I am Tony. Sark let's go and do the
next one space plus, and then no,

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:02.350
I am poppy. Now this
is a bit magical here.

00:12:02.351 --> 00:12:07.140
We have our three strings and we're
adding them together with the plus

00:12:07.141 --> 00:12:09.840
side, which puts a whole
new spin on word problems.

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:14.190
This is commonly referred
to is concatenating. Did
I spell that right? Yeah.

00:12:14.191 --> 00:12:17.850
I think so. Concatenate or
essentially combining things together.

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:19.950
So do you think this will solve
our problem? Let's try it out.

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:22.080
You probably already guessed. No,
but let's go ahead and run it.

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:24.360
It's going to have a problem. You're
probably not anticipating though.

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:27.060
So this is going to be fun.
Ready? Let's run it. Okay.

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:31.290
It definitely combine them. But do
you see something off about this, bro?

00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:35.730
You did give us spaces
between our sentences. That's
basically grammar Python.

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:38.250
Come on. What is this?
This combining them like,

00:12:38.251 --> 00:12:40.950
you don't know how to speak and the
computer doesn't write the computer.

00:12:40.951 --> 00:12:44.280
Doesn't speak English. Doesn't
understand this crap understands Python.

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:49.020
And we literally told him to do that.
That's our fault. What do I mean,

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.220
look at this. We said,

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:53.460
take this string and combine it with
this one as a human we're thinking. Yeah,

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:57.630
those are two sentences. Put a space
between sentences. The computer's like,

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:02.400
um, I don't see the space character
there because space is a character.

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:05.760
He hasn't seen, he went here
and he doesn't see anyone
here. So he just assumes,

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:06.780
yeah. You want me to add those together?

00:13:06.781 --> 00:13:09.570
Then I'm going to add those characters
together. There is no space character.

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:12.450
There is no spoon anyways. So how
do you think we fixed that? Glenn,

00:13:12.451 --> 00:13:14.610
pause the video and try it real
quick. It's it's very simple.

00:13:14.611 --> 00:13:16.110
So don't make it too complex.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:20.250
Just try to fix one of the easiest ways
to fix this is by simply adding a space.

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:22.200
So like for example, here I am iron man.

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:25.080
We can add a space and I forgot my
period earlier. So I'll add a period.

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:29.400
Just add a space at the end of that
string. And when I run that code of Wala,

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:30.990
we've got our space character there.

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:34.590
Let's do the same thing over here
after our second string and our second

00:13:34.591 --> 00:13:38.520
sentence period space, I'll run that
code. Beautiful. It looks better.

00:13:38.521 --> 00:13:40.320
Doesn't it? Yeah, we did
not complete our mission.

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:44.010
Remember I wanted each of these sentences
or each of these strings on their own

00:13:44.011 --> 00:13:47.160
line as we did before. So
how do we fix this again?

00:13:47.161 --> 00:13:48.840
If you already know video and try it,

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:52.410
let's keep going and easy way to fix
this is this handy hack right here,

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:57.150
right in the string. I'm going to do a
backslash and the letter N and that's it.

00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:01.680
So notice it is inside my
string as part of the string.

00:14:01.681 --> 00:14:05.670
It's a character. Let's run it and
see what happens. Boom and bam. Okay.

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:09.390
So it created a new line for us that
backslash in end is called a new line

00:14:09.391 --> 00:14:10.560
indicator character.

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:15.720
And it does what we just saw it did and
sort of fix the rest of our stuff to

00:14:15.721 --> 00:14:16.554
make it look great.

00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:20.340
Let's go and add one more new line
character to our second string

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:25.800
backslash N AML run that code.
Now we did it and that's awesome.

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:29.760
But notice, um, it's a little wonky,
got a little extra space right here.

00:14:29.761 --> 00:14:32.100
We may not want, how do we
fix that? We'll get the,

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.560
computer's going to take exactly
what you told to do in Python.

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:36.870
So notice up here in our second string,

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:39.660
we've got the new line indicator
and the right after that,

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:43.410
we've got the space character, and that's
where that guy ended up right there.

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:47.400
Sort of fix that. We just simply
eliminate that space and run our code.

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:49.680
Beautiful. Now,

00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:52.310
can I show you something that will
make a lot of sense right now,

00:14:52.311 --> 00:14:55.310
but it's super cool. And I just have to
show you. Okay. Let's try it out. So,

00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:59.960
um, let's give it lush space
here, type this with me.

00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:05.810
Print for the CS, for our print function.
We're going to print the string.

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.011
And then right after that,

00:15:07.011 --> 00:15:11.810
string had a space and asterisk space and

00:15:11.811 --> 00:15:16.550
type in 100. Now, what do you think
is going to happen right here?

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:20.480
I'll give you a hint. The Astros right
here, Python reads. That is multiply.

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:25.490
You ready? Let's run our code
and run. Boom, boom, boom.

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:28.340
How cool was that right? Talking about
word problems. We can do stuff like that.

00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:31.700
Yes. Python is powerful man. Now
to make things cleaner and cooler.

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:34.790
What do you say? We add our
new line indicator character.

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:38.450
Where would we put that to make it all
on its own line? Try it out real quick.

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:43.520
I'm going to do it here.
Backslash in right after poppy.

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:47.210
Let's run our code now. Oh, gorgeous. I.

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:50.720
Am poppy. I poppy. I am.
I am. I am popping poppy.

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:54.770
Ooh, we covered a lot today.
First we established that. Yeah.

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:58.100
You got to learn Python right now
because if you want to be in it,

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:00.050
that's kind of the standard now. Sure.

00:16:00.051 --> 00:16:02.810
It doesn't necessarily have to be
the Python programming language.

00:16:02.811 --> 00:16:05.210
It can be something else. But
the defacto standard right now,

00:16:05.211 --> 00:16:08.750
the most popular one out there
is Python for it. Professionals.

00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:11.150
I've been saying it for a long
time. Check my previous videos,

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:15.560
you got to learn Python. And the best
time is always right now. We also covered,

00:16:15.561 --> 00:16:17.630
Hey, what? The junk is Python. At the way,

00:16:17.631 --> 00:16:20.930
we talk to our computer to tell him what
to do to let them know we're the boss.

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:23.330
And then we saw how we could tell
him to do a few things like, Hey,

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.930
talk computer, print this out.
We learned the print function.

00:16:26.931 --> 00:16:31.040
We learn what a string was
also multiline strengths.

00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:34.430
And then we learned some strings basics.
And while we covered a lot today,

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:38.330
we are just scratching. The surface
Python gets so much more fun.

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:42.530
And in the coming episodes, just a
bunch of mind blowing moments. Anyways,

00:16:42.531 --> 00:16:44.000
that's all I have for episode one.

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:45.680
Let me know what you think
in the comments below.

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:49.070
Is there anything you want me to
do differently, better or less of?

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:50.330
I don't know. Let me know.

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:52.670
And also don't forget to hack
the YouTube algorithm today.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.460
Like this video comment,
notification bell subscribe.

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:58.760
We've got to hack YouTube
today. Ethically of course.

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:02.180
And of course a massive shout out to
the sponsor of this entire series.

00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:05.060
It pro TV. Again, if you
want to learn anything in it,

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:06.890
if you want to become an
it professional there,

00:17:06.891 --> 00:17:11.300
the best place to go to learn this stuff.
So link below or code network. Chuck,

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:16.250
you get 30% off forever anyways.
Yeah, I think that's all I have. Uh,

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:18.710
keep a lookout for future episodes.
They will be coming out here.

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:22.900
I'll catch you guys next time.

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:43.750
