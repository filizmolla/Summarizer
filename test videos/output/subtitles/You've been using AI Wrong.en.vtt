00:00:00.205 --> 00:00:02.430
I found a new AI tool and I am obsessed.

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:06.000
It's completely open source and I use it
every day. It's called Fabric. Daniel,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:06.990
tell me what fabric is.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:11.070
So basically the goal is
to augment humans with ai,

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.120
so it's all about reducing that
friction to be able to use AI for your.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.500
Problems. That's Daniel Meer,

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.280
the creator of Fabric Reducing Friction
so you can use AI to solve your

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.190
problems. That's the real
purpose of technology and ai,

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.230
and that's what this Project
Fabric is helping us do.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.900
I legit use this every day
and I think you might too.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.810
So in this video we're going to break
down what Fabric is and I'll show you how

00:00:30.815 --> 00:00:33.840
to set this up so you can start using it
right now and later in this video I'll

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.050
show you how I use Fabric to
access my local AI server. Terry,

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.750
wherever I go with a sponsor
of this video, twin Gate,

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.070
we'll talk more about them later.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.560
Okay? You want to see
something absolutely crazy?

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.160
Yes, Daniel, I do get you
coffee ready? Let's do this.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.210
Now before we dive too deep,

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.210
I want to give you a feel for
what Using Fabric is kind of like,

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.890
what's the use case? What
would I use this for?

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.770
This you're going to love watch this.
Let's say I've got a YouTube video,

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.440
this two hour interview that
maybe I don't have time to watch,

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.100
so I'll grab the link and on my
command line I'll use the tool YT dash

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:03.900
transcript and paste the link,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.570
and this is going to grab the transcript
of that YouTube video. By the way,

00:01:06.575 --> 00:01:10.200
this is a tool that's built into fabric.
That alone makes this thing amazing.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.130
Then I'll pipe that over into Fabric
two hour YouTube video. Here we go.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.260
Within moments I'm told about David
Bumble and everything we discuss in this

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.470
video, the ideas, insights, quotes,

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.780
like this one man who said that smart guy.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.560
So within a few moments I took a two
hour YouTube interview and extracted all

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.930
the wisdom and insights I need
to know. That's crazy, right?

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.780
So what's happening here? What is
Fabric doing? Let's break that down.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.500
First we start off with some kind of
text. In this case, a YouTube transcript.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.290
It really could be anything. And then
Fabric will send this text, in this case,

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.420
our YouTube transcripts
off to your favorite ai.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.260
It could be models from open ai,
anthropic or even local models with Alama,

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.715
which again,

00:01:46.715 --> 00:01:49.500
I will show you how to access a local
server from anywhere using to one gate

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.180
here in a bit. Now looking at the command,

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.060
it's not just sending the transcript
by itself. Here you go, ai.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.820
It's using this thing called
Extract Wisdom. What is that?

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.940
This is the secret sauce behind fabric
and something you should get pretty

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.280
excited about. Daniel,
tell us more about it.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.050
What I've done is take any piece of AI
from any platform that is interesting and

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.020
usually the language that I
care about is actually prompts.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.090
So what we started doing is collecting
all these prompts into this concept

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.920
called patterns.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.850
A set of instructions or a way to get
the AI to do what we want it to do. Now,

00:02:20.855 --> 00:02:24.420
this is not a new concept. Prompt
engineering is a thing, but this,

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.750
it's a bit different, different in
two ways that I am a big fan of.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.870
They're open source and they're
crowdsourced. I'll be the first to admit.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.230
That's kind of a weird concept for a
prompt, but here's why it's cool. First,

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.750
these prompts or patterns, we'll
just call 'em patterns from now on,

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.630
have been carefully curated,
created, manipulated,

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.260
added to do exactly what it's
designed to do to solve a problem,

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.250
a very specific problem,

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.690
and it's everyone including maybe you
that helps create these prompts to make

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.960
them better. Now, let's take a look at
this one in particular. I love this one,

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.600
extract wisdom. You'll really get a
feel for what I'm talking about here.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.190
And this is the other
cool part about this.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.470
It's open source so you can
actually see this system prompt.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.030
Normally when you're
interacting with GPTs,

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.180
you can't see the actual prompt
being sent to the AI here,

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.210
we're controlling that. We're part of
that and I want to show you this one part.

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:08.710
I think this will illustrate
what I'm talking about.

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.540
Look at how this prompt talks to the ai.
Take a step back, think step by step,

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.460
think deeply. It kind of sounds like
he's talking to this AI like a human,

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.920
and that's exactly the
case. Even Daniel said.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.960
You're basically telling
it to act like a human.

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.280
We don't know why it works,

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.960
but just talking to these AI like
they're humans elicits a better response,

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.870
better results. Kind of scary
Do with that what you will,

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.490
but I point that out to say that these
prompts have been tested time and time

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.550
again added to similar to what you
would see with open source code,

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.830
and this is just one pattern.
Look over here on the side,

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.770
look at all of these that have been
created and you don't have to stop there.

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.150
You can create your own, which I've done
that and oh my gosh, that's the secret.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.560
It's so amazing. But hold on,

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.760
you might be like me and think this
kind of seems just like fancy prompts.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.310
What is this thing actually doing
that I can't just do with chat?

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.200
GBTI want to revisit this idea Fabric
is all about reducing friction to have

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.850
AI help you solve problems.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.240
And one of the areas of friction I didn't
even realize I had was the fact that I

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.600
had to keep going out to chat
GBT, open up a web interface,

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.800
load up maybe a custom GBT or start
having a conversation and it didn't feel

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.190
like a lot of time, but that is
time it gets in the way fabric,

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.520
and this is one of the reasons I
fell in love with it is CLI native.

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:25.660
You do everything here in the CLI,
which I get may or may not excite you,

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.390
but you're not limited to that.
Daniel Meer touches more on that.

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.230
What I'm trying to do is make the
on-ramp to using these things as easy as

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.570
possible. So I want to be
able to use them via voice.

00:04:34.575 --> 00:04:38.530
I want to be able to use them
via command line via a gooey app.

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.380
I want to be able to just access
them as quickly as possible.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.700
So that's the main thrust of
this project is to collect

00:04:45.705 --> 00:04:49.120
problems, collect the solutions
in the form of these patterns,

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.910
and then to have as many
on-ramps onto them as well.

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.310
Now I'll talk more about why I love
that it's here in the command line,

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.080
but it's more than just
how you interact with it.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.960
Think about how you might use this to
build programs instead of going through

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.940
the pain of interfacing with AI APIs.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.350
So that's kind of hard to say
actually it wasn't. Anyways,

00:05:05.425 --> 00:05:07.630
you can just use fabric.
Now check this out.

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.610
I want to show you something
I did actually yesterday.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.320
I'm trying to build my
cardiovascular health.

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.740
So I started running and rowing and I
tracked that with the app called Strava,

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.720
which gets all sorts of amazing data.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.430
So I wrote a Python script to interact
with their API to pull down all my data

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.800
and it looks like this,
a bunch of messy JSON,

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.310
but I created a pattern called Workout
summary and it takes care of the JSON for

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.640
me or I can just bake fabric
right inside my Python script.

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.250
And that's just a simple
example. This thing is crazy.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.590
Now we're about to set this up, but
I want to talk about one more thing.

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:40.510
It's called a World of Text
and it's a concept that I'm

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:44.020
really adopting now, thank you to Daniel
Mesler. Go ahead and tell him Daniel,

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.130
about this world of text.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.670
20 Years ago I got into this guy
named David Allen who basically said,

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:52.390
never ever store anything in
your brain. Immediately capture.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.890
What I do now is I capture a concept or
a structure for an essay or something.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.660
I capture it immediately in a note and
now that it's text and because I'm fairly

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.060
proficient with Vim and the Terminal,

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:09.980
my whole world is text and the ability
to manipulate text and I have all my

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.670
notes in text and when I record
something that's actually sound,

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:17.870
I immediately transcribe it, send it
to Notion, and so it's also in text.

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:22.820
So now I have this world of text that
I could use and now I have this AI

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:27.320
infrastructure that manipulates text
using AI to get results that help us as

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:27.860
humans.

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.670
So it's about getting everything into a
text format so it can be used anywhere

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:33.410
by anything, especially ai.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.740
And notice when I run these commands
like getting this YouTube transcript,

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.000
it's outputting this in marked down
format so it can play nice pretty much

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.640
wherever it goes, especially
my notes application obsidian.

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:46.340
Now we'll touch more on the philosophy
of why I think this is amazing and I'll

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:48.110
show you a few more patterns
I've been working with.

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:51.980
But now let's get you set up. Let's
get fabric on your computer right now.

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.490
And by the way,

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.340
if you want to see the full Daniel Meisler
interview where we talk about a ton

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.380
of other stuff from cybersecurity,

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:01.370
AI scares to just bonding over
coffee because we both love coffee.

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:04.160
I'll have that full interview on Network
Check Academy. Just check that out.

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:08.030
Anyways, what do we need? Honestly, just
a computer. Now, as I mentioned before,

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:12.560
this is Command Line World and this is
going to be a Linux-based or Unix-based

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.260
system, but we're not leaving
out anybody here. You got a Mac,

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:19.250
it works great on Mac. In fact,
Daniel Mesler, all he does is use Mac.

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:22.280
He loves it. Linux, of course, if
you use Linux is your main desktop,

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.850
you'll have a good time. And then
Windows, which is what I use WSL,

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:28.460
the Windows subsystem for
Linux, so it'll work everywhere.

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:32.090
You have Linux and Linux is everywhere.
What a time to be alive, right?

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:36.830
Coffee break. For that coffee break, the
setup and install is actually really,

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:37.663
really fast.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:41.150
I'm going to set up a new machine
here in WSL on my Windows machine.

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:43.220
You don't have to do this unless
you don't already have one.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.270
And then best practice,

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:48.950
just go ahead and do a pseudo a PT update
to update your repos and go ahead and

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:51.890
run a pseudo a PT upgrade if
you haven't already. Now on Mac,

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:52.790
you don't have to do that,

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:55.130
just make sure you have your system
updates and you'll be golden.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.350
Now let's install Fabric,
Mac, windows, Linux.

00:07:57.355 --> 00:07:58.460
We're all following along right now.

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:02.930
First we'll just copy and
paste this command cloning
the Fabric project from Git

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:06.140
Hub. If we type in ls, there's
the fabric project right there.

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:09.560
We'll go ahead and jump in there, CD
fabric. And then to install everything,

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:13.070
we'll use a tool called PIP x, but
we'll have to install PIP X first.

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:17.720
Now on Mac and Windows with WSL,
we'll do a pseudo a PT install Pip x.

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:20.360
If you're on Mac, you'll want
to use a tool called Brew.

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:24.020
Brew is an amazing utility and I think
Package Manager that enables you to

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.540
install a ton of things and
you should have it on your Mac.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.970
So install brew first if
you don't already have it.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:34.040
And then with the Command Brew,
say Brew, install PIP x. Again,

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:37.040
that's Mac only. I'll go
ahead and install PIP X. Yep,

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:40.400
and now we'll install Fabric
with pip x. Simply type in pip.

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:42.980
I've been sing PIP XA lot, it's
making me feel weird. Anyways,

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:46.940
pip x install dot, that
should be it. Ready, set,

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:50.630
go and done. We have all
these tools installed.

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:53.600
I do have a note from me saying that
my path variables aren't correct.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:56.160
I'll just run this command real quick.
You might have to do the same thing.

00:08:56.310 --> 00:09:00.660
Pit backs Ensure Path done, and
now Fabric is almost ready to go.

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:05.610
We'll just need to run one command
fabric, dash dash setup. Oh wait,

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:07.350
I got to refresh my
terminal. If you're in Linux,

00:09:07.355 --> 00:09:11.130
you'll do source tilda or library
sign, whatever you want to call that.

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:15.930
Bash rc. If you're on
Mac wll, be Z-S-H-R-C.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.460
If you're using ZSH as your default.

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:19.800
And now we should be able to
do fabric dash dash setup.

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:22.980
And what this will do is ask you
for a couple things. Your open AI,

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:27.570
API key if you want to use G PT four
and all those other models and also your

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:31.650
Anthropic API key to use the cloud
models. Now what that means is yes,

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:35.130
you will need an API key. So if you
don't already have one, go get one.

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:36.960
I'll put a link down below
showing you how to do that.

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:39.510
I'm going to grab mine real
quick and I'll paste that there.

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:42.450
And then my Claude API key,
which is the Anthropic API key.

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:45.360
And then one more thing, it's
going to want your YouTube API key.

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:48.210
So when you are going out to YouTube
to pull those transcripts from videos,

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:51.180
you can even do comments. It will
use a Google, YouTube, API key.

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.530
Those are free to set up. Again,

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:54.240
I'll have a link below to
show you how to do that.

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:58.740
And once you've added your
API keys, that's it. Now
you may be wondering, Chuck,

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:00.150
why do we have to do that? Well, remember,

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:03.510
fabric is just a framework
in itself is not ai.

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:06.510
It will use whatever favorite AI you have.

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:09.960
Now that does mean that if you're
using Open AI or anthropic,

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:13.140
you're going to have to pay for that
usage and it's a pay as you go thing.

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:14.490
Put your credit card in there.

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:18.300
Most of the time it does end up being
cheaper than just paying for Chad GPT the

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:20.070
Pro, but just keep that in mind. Now,

00:10:20.075 --> 00:10:22.950
if you don't want to pay anything and you
don't want to give any data to anybody

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:27.030
ever, there's local LLMs as well, which
Fabric just added. Thank you, Daniel.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:31.230
So if you have Alama installed or llama
installed on a remote server like I do

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:35.400
on Terry, we can type in fabric
and do dash dash list models.

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:38.790
And right here are the available local
models. I'll grab a YouTube video.

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:41.370
This one by Peter McKinnon,
I've been meaning to watch.

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:43.020
I'll just grab the summary
and then with Fabric,

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:46.530
I'll do a dash dash model
to specify a certain model.

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:50.070
In my case it'll be
LAMA three colon latest.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:55.590
Then I'll do dash SP to specify the
pattern, which will be Extract Wisdom.

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:58.410
And just like that, I'm
using a local model.

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:02.100
Now if I want to use a bigger
model like Llama three seven db,

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.280
that's not going to run on my local
computer, but it will run on Terry.

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:07.530
So to connect to a remote AI server,

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:10.800
specify remote llama server,

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:14.820
put the IP address in of your
remote server. This is Terry.

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:19.290
Specify the model Llama three 70 B,

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:22.830
and then your pattern. Now I'm not sure
what the whole Alex and Jordan thing,

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.530
but that's how you do it.
And when I'm away from Terry,

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:28.860
when I'm out of the office remote
somewhere, I still want to talk to him.

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:32.760
And here's how I do it. When I'm working
remote out and about as I normally do,

00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:35.430
I got to make sure I can run my
fabric commands and access Terry.

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:38.850
Wherever I am right now, it's not
going to work. I'm getting nothing.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.230
That's where Twin Gate comes in.

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:44.340
My favorite way to remotely access my
stuff back at home, my office, my studio,

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:46.980
everything. Setting up Twin
Gate is pretty stinking easy,

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:49.710
easier than standing in
a field. What was that?

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:52.440
All you have to do is set up a free
twin gate account, create a network,

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:53.620
and then deploy connector.

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:57.100
It could be a Docker container on a
Raspberry Pi in your house or running on

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:58.870
your Sonology nas like I do at my home.

00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:02.230
And within a few minutes you get remote
access to everything you want to like

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:06.670
now lighting strikes, nah, I'm
good. Wildlife maybe. What was that?

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:09.850
But seriously, wherever I go,
wherever I am, other hidden holes,

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:12.580
I can remotely access my stuff
back at home, including Terry.

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:16.240
My AI server Twin Gate is special because
they use all the latest and greatest

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.160
technologies to make sure
your connection is fast,

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.970
including quick one of the new internet
protocols that is blazingly fast.

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:25.180
And with Twin Gate, you can control
exactly what your people have access to.

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:28.660
All my employees, I don't want you using
Terry when you're away from the office,

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:31.870
but you can log into the server
and work. I'll allow that.

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:34.780
So if you want to use my remote access
solution, check it out, link below.

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:37.720
I've been using it for over a year and
it's my favorite way to remotely access

00:12:37.725 --> 00:12:40.780
everything. I even did it when I was
in Japan too. Worked great. Alright,

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:41.613
I'm getting out of here.

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:46.150
Now let's get a bit more advanced and
break down some fabric stuff first.

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:49.750
You don't have to just give it stuff
like copy and paste from a YouTube

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:51.790
transcript or something
to work with fabric.

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:55.120
You could ask a basic question
like watch this. I can echo saying,

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:59.800
give me a list of all ice
creams flavors and what year

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:03.700
they originated. Actually,
I'm pretty curious about that.

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:06.130
I'll pipe that into fabric and
we'll break this down a bit.

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:09.100
So far we've been using
the command or the switch.

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:13.180
Sp that's a combined switch. Let's
split 'em up so we can talk about it.

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:17.740
So dash s and dash P dash s is for
stream. And when we use that switch,

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:21.970
we're telling it to go ahead and output
whatever the AI says as it's saying it

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:25.450
stream it to us. PP is for
specifying the pattern.

00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:28.300
So right after you put the
pattern you want to use,

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:31.480
and we'll just say the pattern
ai, which is a specific pattern,

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:35.470
just allowing us to talk
with AI just told me, no,

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:40.450
you can't do the AI exceeds practical
limits. You exceed practical limits.

00:13:40.455 --> 00:13:44.560
I'm just kidding. Let's try something
more easy. There we go. Now we're talking.

00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:46.900
And by the way, when I use
fabric about specifying a model,

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:51.010
it defaults to using open AI and GPT-4
Turbo. If you want to change that,

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:52.660
especially if you want
to stick to local models,

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:57.610
we can do fabric dash list models to
see all our models and then do fabric,

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:02.740
dash, dash change default model
and then specify the model.

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:06.400
Now we can also do the command
fabric, dash dash list,

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:10.120
just the list and it'll list all the
available patterns we have right now.

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:13.750
Again, so many things you can play with.
Now I want to show you something crazy.

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:18.430
As Daniel mentioned before, the theme
behind fabric is very well, fabric E,

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:22.840
so you got fabric, then you've got
patterns. If you want to run a server,

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.770
which does some fun stuff, I'm not going
to cover right now, it's called a mill.

00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:29.260
But you can also do
what's called stitching,

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:33.190
which allows you to stitch patterns
together. So let's try this.

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:37.000
I've got this article, this long
read about that YouTuber poppy,

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:41.200
do you remember her? She's still around.
She's crazy. It's super long read.

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:45.640
I'm just going to copy and
paste everything and put
this into fabric PB paste

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:48.550
fabric. And by the way, I know
you're probably wondering, Chuck,

00:14:48.555 --> 00:14:50.860
how are you doing that?
What is this PB paste thing?

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:55.190
This is built in by default
into Max. So if you have a Mac,

00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:59.330
just enjoy it on WSL and
Linux. It's harder to do.

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:01.640
I'll show you how to do that here in
a minute. And if I run out of time,

00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:03.890
I'll show you somewhere else. Anyways,

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:06.740
we'll paste that in there and
I'll use the prompt, summarize.

00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:07.970
So summarize the article,

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:12.890
and then I'll pipe that result into
another fabric command or stitch

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:16.250
it. And this pattern will be right essay.

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:20.660
Actually I'll do a dash s so we can see
that streamed in and go. Now fabric,

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:22.430
while it's doing this thing, just
think about what it's doing right now.

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:25.400
First it's going to summarize
that entire article.

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:29.540
Then it's going to kick its summary
over to the right essay pattern.

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:32.780
That's powerful. This is
crazy. Writing an essay.

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:35.870
We can also do a thing where we
analyze the claims of the article.

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:40.640
This is not stitching, I just want
to see what happens. Analyze claims,

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:45.710
I mean, this is just cool. Again, these
prompts, crowdsourced, open sourced,

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:49.520
they've been meddled with and messed
with to make 'em perfect and they're not

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:51.770
perfect. I mean they're still
going to be worked on improved.

00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:57.020
You can also do one called label and
rate giving it a quality score saying

00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:59.210
it's B tier, consume when time allows.

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:03.500
This is another superpower of fabric and
the idea and the mentality is bringing

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:06.980
two AI and how you might
approach your life.

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:09.800
We'll talk more about that here in a
minute. I don't want to dive too deep,

00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:13.280
but now I want to show you how you can
create your own patterns because right

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:15.800
now we're using what's
built in default just there.

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:19.160
So I'll show you how you can approach
writing a pattern and then getting it into

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.980
fabric so you can use it. Keeping in
mind that when you write a pattern,

00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:25.940
it remains local to you. It doesn't
get uploaded to the fabric repository,

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:29.150
and none of that's happening unless you
want to submit it. That's up to you.

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:32.540
Everything's still private. But when I
first started trying to write patterns,

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:33.740
I didn't really know how to do it.

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:36.800
So I would just go and pick one of
my favorite ones, extract wisdom,

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:40.370
and just kind of modify it, which
is absolutely a great way to do it.

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:43.700
But then I found this, there's a pattern.
There's a pattern for everything. See,

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:45.560
a pattern means solving a problem.

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:50.150
There's a pattern called Improve Prompt
that basically does everything for you.

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:53.180
It's crazy. So check this
out, we'll do it real quick.

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:55.760
We'll echo something and say you are,

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:58.520
we'll just try to write it on
prompt real quick, but messy, dirty.

00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:01.460
And by the way, this is a real
example of how I wanted to,

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:05.000
and I talked with Daniel about this,
how I wanted to digest sermons better.

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:06.320
I go to church every Sunday.

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:09.110
Sometimes I'm serving in the
nursery taking care of babies,

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:10.640
and I miss the sermon. Now,

00:17:10.645 --> 00:17:12.890
I rarely have time to go back and
watch the sermon throughout the week.

00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:16.490
So if I could just somehow digest
it like this, that'd be amazing.

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:19.400
But I wanted to create a pattern
that would look for specific things,

00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:22.280
unique to a sermon. So
let's try this. Alright,

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:26.930
so I'll pipe that out to fabric and
I'll do the pattern and prove prompt.

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:32.240
That's crazy, right? This is so cool.
So this is just live off the cuff.

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:33.590
I'm going to take this, copy it.

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:37.070
So now I've got my instruction and
I'm going to go to the place where our

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:40.010
patterns live. Here's where
they live. We'll go to cd.

00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:44.270
We'll do dot config
slash fabric type in Ls.

00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:46.940
Here we can see we have
a directory for patterns.

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:49.560
That's the patterns that fabric we'll use.

00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:52.500
And then we have a directory called
My Patterns, which is what I created.

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:55.350
So go ahead and make that for yourself
right now. We'll do a mic directory,

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:59.790
M-K-D-I-R, let's call it
my super Awesome Patterns.

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:02.640
I'll jump in there. And then
to create our new pattern,

00:18:02.645 --> 00:18:06.840
we'll make a new directory.
Call it Sermon Sensei.

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:10.200
It's a has how spell Sensei?
Nope. We'll CD in there.

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:15.570
And we'll make a new file called
System md. Do nano system md.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:19.410
Jump in there and I'll paste the
contents of that pattern. Control X,

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:21.390
Y enter to safe. So to
summarize what we just did,

00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:26.250
we created a directory to how our custom
patterns and inside that directory,

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:30.120
we made a new directory creating
a new pattern sermon sensei,

00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:31.920
and we created a file called System md,

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:34.890
which is the system prompt to the
actual contents of the pattern. Now,

00:18:34.895 --> 00:18:38.490
the reason we created our own super
awesome special directory is that often

00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:40.860
patterns will be updated because
again, this is open sourced,

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:44.070
crowdsourced patterns are always being
improved. And if they're in the repo,

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:45.450
you'll want to update your patterns.

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:49.410
So we might do this fabric dash update
and that'll update your patterns,

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:52.740
but it will overwrite anything
that doesn't belong in there.

00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:56.430
So we're keeping our custom patterns
inside my super awesome patterns.

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:57.540
That way they're never deleted,

00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:00.420
but to make sure they can be used
by fabric when we run our commands,

00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:04.020
we do need to copy everything
into the Patterns folder.

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:07.950
So we'll do that real quick.
We'll simply do copy or CP dash r,

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:09.150
we'll specify our directory,

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:14.070
our home directory symbol tilda
slash config slash fabric slash your

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:17.040
directory. So mine is super awesome,
that super awesome patterns.

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:21.240
We'll do the asterisk to make sure all
the folders and stuff are copied just so

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:26.880
into R patterns, directory config,
fabric patterns, just like that.

00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:30.450
So now if we do fabric dash
dash list to list our patterns,

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:34.020
I should see sermon sensei right there.

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.630
Notice I have another one called Sermon
Wisdom, which I had previously created.

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:41.340
Now let's test out Sermon sensei. I'm
going to grab the sermon from my church,

00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:45.870
one of our recent ones. Do yt, grab
that transcript, put the URL there,

00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:51.720
and then pipe that into fabric using
my sermon sensei pattern I just

00:19:51.725 --> 00:19:54.930
created. Now this is pretty cool and
honestly I think it needs some work.

00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:57.960
So just like the open source
patterns in the fabric repo,

00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:59.910
you can work on yours and keep iterating.

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:04.560
So the one I really enjoy is the one I
created Sermon Wisdom that I think does a

00:20:04.565 --> 00:20:07.440
better job and that really does
demonstrate the power of a really,

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:10.110
really good prompt. I mean, I
love how it pulls out quotes.

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:11.370
Probably one of my favorite things,

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:14.400
and that was killer is the references
pulling out all the scripture or things

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:18.030
that he mentioned in the sermon. I
love that. Now looking back at Fabric,

00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:20.610
if we type in fabric help,

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:22.680
we can see there are options
we haven't mentioned yet.

00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:23.940
We're not going to go over all of them,

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:27.300
but one thing I do want to touch
on is the idea of a context.

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:28.920
I'll let Daniel talk
about that real quick.

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:34.050
This is the latest thing that I've
been working on under Config Fabric.

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:37.350
We now have a context file.

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:42.270
My context file is about
increasing human flourishing by

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:45.810
helping people identify, articulate,
and pursue their purpose in life.

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:49.600
Helping people transition to
Human 3.0 to be our best selves.

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:53.950
This is literally my soul that
I'm translating it to text.

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:56.800
I haven't done this yet, but I want
to make a context for myself soon.

00:20:56.890 --> 00:20:57.910
Now I've got two more features.

00:20:57.910 --> 00:21:02.890
I want to show you the PV paste option
for Linux users and the ability to save

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:06.760
anything you create with Fabric two
obsidian, my favorite notes application,

00:21:06.765 --> 00:21:09.910
what I use and what I've been obsessing
over for a while now. Oh, it's so cool.

00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:11.590
I just found this. But
before we get there,

00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:15.700
I want to talk more about the philosophy
behind Fabric and why it's kind of

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:19.660
captured my imagination and why I
feel like it's more than just a fancy

00:21:19.665 --> 00:21:21.400
prompter. Now, to understand that,

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:24.880
I think we need to know a bit more about
Daniel Mesler. Daniel Meer is a hacker.

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:27.160
That's his background. That's
what he did and still does.

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:32.170
And the reason I created it is
because I basically went independent

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:36.190
as of the end of 22. As soon as the ai,

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:40.570
as soon as GPT-4 launched, I was
working at Robinhood at the time.

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:42.670
I built a VM program over there.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.600
And before that I was at Apple
and a bunch of other places,

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:50.830
and I had been in AI for five, six years.

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:54.190
But when I saw g BT four happen,
I was like, okay, I'm out.

00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:56.920
I basically got out and said,
I need to do this full time.

00:21:57.250 --> 00:22:00.940
So I started collecting all this different
AI stuff as I'm sure everyone has

00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:04.540
seen. And what I found after a
couple of months is like, okay,

00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:07.030
I've got a million different prompts.
Now what do I actually do with them?

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:11.260
What I started doing is collecting them
into an infrastructure that I could use

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:14.170
personally, and this is a
little bit before Fabric,

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:17.020
but it became the content for Fabric.

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:20.350
And essentially what it turns
into is these patterns here.

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:24.880
And you can tell just by using these
patterns that this is the result of many,

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:27.640
many iterations. It does things so well.

00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:30.130
And if you've been using
AI for a while, again,

00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:34.540
you know what it feels like to use a
really good prompt and had your results be

00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:39.280
so clean and almost exactly what you were
looking for or even more than what you

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:40.690
expected. And that's so fun.

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:43.660
Now I want to get back to the
idea of human flourishing. Again,

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:47.020
that is the goal of the Fabric Project,
and honestly, when you hear that,

00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:51.550
it kind of captures your imagination,
right? I love, because for me,

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:53.890
I dunno if you're like this,
but the more AI advances,

00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:57.190
the more I get just a little bit more
scared of where my place in the world

00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:59.500
might be. But when I hear
about projects like Fabric,

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:01.120
where it's not about replacing humans,

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:04.090
but about augmenting humans
to help us become better,

00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:07.660
to help us think better and to
help us consume more content.

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:10.780
And that's one of the main things
that Daniel uses this tool for.

00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:14.410
One of the main reasons he created this
tool is that there's so much content

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:18.220
being produced all the time from
YouTube videos to podcasts to articles.

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:22.660
Just staying relevant in your space and
your niche takes a tremendous amount of

00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:24.970
time. Time. You don't
have to consume things.

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:29.620
A big part of it is I am using
it to determine what I should go

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:33.640
watch regularly. In fact, I'm actually
building a product around that called,

00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:36.670
but I won't say what it's called, but
I'm building a product around that.

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:40.870
So just because I need it
in my life, essentially,

00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:45.650
I'm using it as a filter to determine
what I should go watch and then go watch

00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:48.500
it fully. And oftentimes
I take manual notes,

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:51.890
but I watch or listen
to it in its entirety,

00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:55.550
and then I go and take notes
on it and it spawns thoughts.

00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:58.640
So I'm not stepping away and disengaging,

00:23:58.645 --> 00:24:01.400
I'm still reading massive number of books,

00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:06.350
I'm still watching the videos,
I'm still reading the essays.

00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:11.330
What this is helping me do is
just filter out or filter up or

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:15.020
raise attention to the particular
stuff that I want to watch.

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:19.280
So a big way he uses fabric
is to filter out what is good,

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:24.350
what deserves a long watch or what
just needs to be summarized and

00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:25.280
quickly digest it.

00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:29.180
And it's so cool because
the way he created fabric
in a lot of these prompts is

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:30.530
he designed these prompts,

00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:34.310
these patterns in a way that is meant
to mimic the way he would approach

00:24:34.315 --> 00:24:34.940
something,

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:38.000
the way he would watch a video and
take notes the way he would listen to a

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.190
podcast and take notes.
It's kind of crazy.

00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:45.050
My very first thing that I made for
Fabric is the ability to emulate as if I

00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:48.830
took slow notes on a
piece of content by hand.

00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:50.330
And that's what this emulates.

00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:52.250
Now a little story time.
The past six months,

00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:55.310
I've been on a journey
of being very particular,

00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:58.940
very intentional with what I
consume, how I spend my time,

00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:03.560
and writing down as many things as I can,
taking good notes, processing things.

00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:05.510
And that led me to my
question I asked Daniel,

00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:08.090
and that's if we start
using things like fabric,

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:12.320
AI tools to do the processing
and thinking for us,

00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:16.010
do we lose that value? So the
curmudgeon in me, the old man in me,

00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:17.540
don't do the AI stuff.

00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:20.750
It's going to keep you from becoming a
deep thinker and learning how to really

00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:23.000
analyze things. But here's
what Daniel said about this.

00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:23.815
Yeah,

00:25:23.815 --> 00:25:28.790
I think the way to use it is to use the

00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:29.660
context stuff

00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:35.540
that we're starting to build now that's
already in the project and basically

00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:38.870
define what you're trying to do. You
can define inside of the context,

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:42.740
I need to learn this
much about these topics,

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:46.550
recommend to me the best
courses to do that with.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.540
And then when you take a piece
of content and it's overwhelming,

00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:54.170
you could put it through fabric
and essentially distill it down.

00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:56.420
And importantly,

00:25:56.930 --> 00:26:01.820
it could tell you what not to distill
down because there's so much advantage to

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:05.030
going back to your earlier point,

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:06.950
you don't want to take the
weights out of the gym.

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:09.470
So everything shouldn't be a summary.

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:12.230
Sometimes you have to
put the hard work in,

00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:17.540
but you can use it to tell you
or advise you or recommend to you

00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:21.860
which things you should do slow and
painful and difficult because that's where

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:22.940
you get the most muscle growth.

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:25.190
Don't take the weights out of the gym.

00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:28.820
So he'll use fabric to help him determine
what should be slowly watched and

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:32.060
processed. We saw that earlier
with the label and rate pattern.

00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:33.950
It tells you like, oh yeah, you
got to watch this right now,

00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:36.380
or you could wait on that. Again,

00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:40.760
it's not about replacing humans replacing
you, it's about making you better,

00:26:40.765 --> 00:26:45.570
about taking your current capabilities
and using AI to increase that at a

00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:46.980
faster rate than you could before.

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:51.900
It's about identifying a problem that you
might have and then creating a pattern

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:53.910
to help you solve that problem.

00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:57.600
And all the patterns you're seeing there
that are built into fabric are a result

00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:00.600
of like, I've got this problem.
Here's a pattern that can fix it.

00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:02.550
And you can do the same
thing for your life.

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:06.540
And we talked a bit about a feedback
loop to where I may have fabric,

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:10.740
I'll create a pattern for this that I'll
look over my journal entries throughout

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:12.270
the week and then it'll tell me,

00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:16.890
maybe you didn't read enough that week
and that's why you're feeling sad. Or,

00:27:16.895 --> 00:27:20.010
Hey, you're feeling fantastic
because you ran four times this week.

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:21.030
Keep doing that.

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:24.600
It's that kind of augmentation that I'm
really excited about and that's where I

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:26.040
see myself growing the fabric.

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:28.830
And I literally use this all
the time for so many things.

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:32.550
Me and Daniel also talked about how we
both started recording conversations.

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:37.620
Like any conversation we have with
a sibling, a friend, a spouse,

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:41.850
record it, then transcribe it with Whisper
ai, which is you can use it locally,

00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:44.670
it's free, and then pipe that into fabric.

00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:48.990
I actually started doing this recently
with, we have a weekly bible study.

00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:52.170
We have a core group of people where
we meet and we talk about our lives and

00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:55.080
things and tell funny stories and talk
about what we were learning and going

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:55.650
through.

00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:59.220
So I recorded that and I created a pattern
that would extract the things I might

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:02.040
care about from those moments.
Check this out. It's so cool.

00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:04.350
So I have the recording transcribed.

00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:08.400
I'll cat that and pipe it into
fabric using my GC analyzer.

00:28:08.550 --> 00:28:11.160
That's what we call our
communities gospel communities.

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:13.620
And I won't show you everything in
this because it's very personal,

00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:15.810
but I want to show you how
cool this is. And honestly,

00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:20.670
this whole fabric project is making
me rethink about the role of AI in

00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:23.910
my life. It's here. Like it or not,
what are you going to use it for?

00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:26.040
How can you use it to
help make you better?

00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:30.780
And that was the first video I made
ever about ai. Chad GPT came out,

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:33.510
I was terrified, but then after
processing it a bit more, I'm like,

00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:36.510
you know what? This is going to
make us better. It's about us.

00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:40.320
It's about humans flourishing.
There was a funny moment about,

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:45.510
it was just a funny story
about sleepwalking and it
found that, that's so cool.

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:49.830
I just did this one. Look at
the funny moments here. Yeah,

00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:52.470
we talk about weird stuff, but
I want to remember that stuff.

00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:56.190
I want to be able to go back to that
search, have that in my second brain.

00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:58.110
That's a video coming soon. And again,

00:28:58.110 --> 00:29:00.510
I talked with Daniel about a
lot more stuff including coffee.

00:29:00.515 --> 00:29:02.700
So if you want to see that entire
talk, that entire conversation,

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:06.330
you can check the link below to Network
Check Academy, which is my new project,

00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:10.050
my baby, where I'm creating it. Courses
to help you become awesome in it.

00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:13.260
I would love for you to join. We have
an amazing community. Go check it out.

00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:16.200
Link below. Now, the two more
things I wanted to show you First,

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:18.450
this PB paste thing.
Actually, you know what,

00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:20.940
I'm not going to show you right here.
I'm going to make a video about it,

00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:23.310
and by the time you watch this
video, that one should already be up.

00:29:23.370 --> 00:29:26.880
So go here somewhere, it's going to
be awesome. Just go and jump there.

00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:30.480
But now to the Obsidian Save
thing, this is so awesome.

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:35.160
So let's take that same
discussion here from my GC

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:37.920
analyzer. I can save that
directly to obsidian.

00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:42.130
There's a command that is baked into
fabric called Save just like this.

00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:46.420
And what that will do is save the contents
of whatever you're doing in fabric to

00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:49.690
a note in obsidian, creating a
new note. Now to make that happen,

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:54.460
we first have to tell fabric where
our obsidian lives in our operating

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:55.960
system. So if you're new to obsidian,

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:59.530
obsidian is all about just text-based
documents. Again, world of text.

00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:03.970
All it is just a bunch of markdown files
and it's somewhere on my hard drive to

00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:08.050
tell fabric where that is. I'll just edit
an environment file. So I'll go nano,

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:13.300
jump it to my config
folder, fabric folder,

00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:17.260
and there should be a file
NV for environment variables.

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:19.750
You can see that's also where
our API keys are stored.

00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:22.390
And here's my path to the directory.

00:30:22.390 --> 00:30:27.070
I want to store new mark dime files
created by fabric. With that in place,

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:29.170
I want to take away the S option.
I don't want to stream it.

00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:30.400
I'm just going to save this to a file.

00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:34.090
So I'll pipe it out to the save command
and then I'll just name it and go.

00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:36.130
And then if I jump into my obsidian,

00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:37.720
which we're going to shield
most of this from you,

00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:43.060
if I go to my specific folder, there
it is. Auto Magically. That's killer.

00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:47.260
Again, it's all about removing friction.
This is so amazing. I love this stuff.

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:48.340
Lemme know if you like this too.

00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:52.060
Lemme know if you want me to make more
videos like this about new AI tools or

00:30:52.065 --> 00:30:55.810
just exploring how we can
improve ourselves and make
ourselves better with the

00:30:55.810 --> 00:30:57.340
help of ai. I don't know.
