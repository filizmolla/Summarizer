## SQLAlchemy: Introduction

- SQLAlchemy is a powerful and flexible Python library for working with databases.
- It allows mapping of database roles and tables to Python objects.
- This ORM (object-relational mapper) supports various SQL databases, including SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.

### Basic Usage (Functional Approach)

- Establish a database connection and create an engine object.
- Define a database schema using a `MetaData` object.
- Create tables and columns using `Table` objects.
- Interact with tables using built-in functions and objects, such as `insert()` and `select()`.

### Object-Oriented Approach

- Create a session using the `sessionmaker()` function.
- Define base and user classes using `declarative_base` and `declarative`.
- Use data classes to define column types (`mapped_integer`, `mapped_string`).
- Add relationships between tables using `relationship()`, specifying one-to-one and one-to-many relationships.

### Relationships

- **One-to-One Relationships (e.g., User and UserAuth)**
  - `Relationship()` indicates a relationship between tables.
  - `backref` allows for synchronization between related tables.
- **One-to-Many Relationships (e.g., User and Posts)**
  - Specify a "backpopulate" user attribute in the Post class to sync relationships.

### Advanced Features

- **Foreign Keys:** Specify foreign keys to link tables (`user_id` in Post refers to User ID).
- **Indexes:** Create indexes to improve query performance (e.g., user ID index in Post).
- **Cascade:** Define behavior when deleting parent objects (e.g., delete posts when user is deleted).

### Password Management

- Create a separate `UserAuth` table for storing hashed passwords.
- Use the `setter` method to create password hashes.
- Define a `check_password` method for verifying passwords.

### Querying and Filtering

- Use session context managers to handle database interactions.
- Filter data using `filter()` (e.g., `User.posts.filter(User.id == 1)`).

### Actionable Advice

- Consider using SQLAlchemy for flexible and object-oriented database interactions.
- Explore the extensive documentation for advanced usage and customization options.
- Understand and utilize relationships, foreign keys, indexes, and cascading features.
- Implement password management for secure authentication.
- Experiment with different methods for querying and filtering data.

### Interesting Facts

- SQLAlchemy uses a "lazy-loading" mechanism to minimize database interactions.
- It supports multiple database backends, allowing for database portability.
