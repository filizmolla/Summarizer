### Top 7 Data Structures for Interviews Explained SIMPLY

#### Overview
- **Purpose**: Discuss the seven most important data structures.
- **Importance**: Essential for coding interviews, computer science classes, and building projects.
- **Structure**: Presented from easiest to hardest for beginners.
- **Time Complexity**: Shown on screen for those interested.

#### 1. Arrays
- **Definition**: Ordered collections of data, typically of a similar type (e.g., integers, strings).
- **Real-life Example**: Storing temperatures for the next five days.
- **Common Uses**: Used frequently in programming.
- **Advantages**:
  - Easy to find any element using an index (zero-based indexing).
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Slightly harder to insert or delete elements.
- **Memory Storage**:
  - Stored in contiguous memory.
  - Inserting in the middle requires shifting elements or reallocating memory.
- **Summary**: 
  - **Good for**: Reading elements.
  - **Less efficient for**: Insertion or deletion.

#### 2. Linked Lists
- **Definition**: Ordered lists of data elements, but stored differently than arrays.
- **Storage**: Each element has a pointer to the next element, allowing non-contiguous storage.
- **Advantages**:
  - Fast insertion and deletion.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Slower reading of elements (must traverse from the beginning).
- **Summary**:
  - **Good for**: Inserting and deleting elements.
  - **Less efficient for**: Reading elements.

#### 3. Hash Maps
- **Definition**: Similar to arrays but with customizable keys (key-value pairs).
- **Characteristics**:
  - Unordered.
  - Fast for inserting, removing, and searching elements.
- **Real-life Example**: Storing capital cities with countries as keys.
- **Other Names**: Hash tables, dictionaries (in Python).
- **Summary**: 
  - **Good for**: Quick searching using custom keys.

---

#### 4. Stacks
- **Definition**: Data structure resembling a stack of plates (Last In, First Out - LIFO).
- **Common Operations**:
  - **Push**: Add a new element to the top.
  - **Pop**: Remove the topmost element.
  - **Peak**: View the topmost element.
- **Use Cases**: Suitable for scenarios where the last element added is the first to be removed.

---

#### 5. Queues
- **Definition**: Data structure resembling a lineup (First In, First Out - FIFO).
- **Common Operations**:
  - **NQ (Enqueue)**: Add a new element to the back.
  - **DQ (Dequeue)**: Remove the front element.
  - **Front**: View the frontmost element.
- **Use Cases**: Frequently used in real-world programming (e.g., YouTube playlists).

---

#### 6. Trees
- **Definition**: Data structures that resemble trees, consisting of nodes connected by edges.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Root Node**: The first node in a tree.
  - **Parent-Child Relationship**: Nodes can have parent and child nodes.
- **Binary Trees**: Each parent node has up to two children.
- **Binary Search Trees**: 
  - Left children are less than the parent node.
  - Right children are greater than the parent node.
- **Real-life Example**: Number guessing game; eliminates half of the possibilities with each guess.
- **Practical Example**: Digital dictionary for quick word lookup.

---

#### 7. Graphs
- **Definition**: Models for a set of connections, made up of nodes and edges.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Less restrictive than trees; nodes can connect to any number of neighbors.
  - Can be directed or undirected.
  - May contain cycles and weighted edges.
- **Complexity**: Considered one of the hardest data structures to learn.
- **Use Case Example**: 
  - Running errands represented as a graph to calculate the shortest route.
  - Real-life application: Uber optimizing waiting times for riders.
