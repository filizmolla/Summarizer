## Nmap Tutorial: Finding Network Vulnerabilities

**Introduction**

* Enmap (Nmap) is a powerful tool for scanning networks and finding vulnerable targets.

## Basic Commands

**Ping Scan:**

* `enmap -sT -p network`

**Port Scan:**

* `enmap -sT -p ports network`
* Utilizes TCP three-way handshake for port detection:
    * Send message
    * Receive SYN-ACK
    * Respond with ACK

**Stealth Scan:**

* `enmap -sS -p ports network`
* Sends only a single SYN message, reducing likelihood of detection

**OS Detection:**

* `enmap -O host`
* Guesses OS based on TCP/IP stack responses

## Advanced Features

**Combo Search:**

* `enmap -A host`
* Performs OS, protocol version, and script scanning

**Decoy:**

* `enmap -D decoy_ip -sT -p ports network`
* Sends decoy packets to confuse attackers

**Scripting Engine:**

* `enmap --script Vulner host`
* Scans for known vulnerabilities using scripts

## Actionable Advice

* Practice commands and switches.
* Understand networking concepts.
* Lower scan speed to avoid detection.

## Techniques

* TCP three-way handshake for port detection
* Host decoy for obfuscation
* Nmap scripts for vulnerability scanning

## Additional Points

* Nmap is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
* Consider using a VPN to avoid detection.
* Vulnhub provides vulnerable virtual machines for ethical hacking practice.
