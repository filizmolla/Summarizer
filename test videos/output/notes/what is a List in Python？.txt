**What is a List in Python?**

**Definition:**
- A Python list is an ordered and changeable collection of data objects.
- Unlike an array, which contains objects of a single type, a list can contain a mixture of objects.

**Features:**

- **Ordered:** Items in a list maintain the order in which they are entered.
- **Indexed:** Each item in a list has a unique index number, allowing for easy access.
- **Mutable:** Lists can be changed (added, removed, sorted, etc.).

**How to Create a List:**

Use square brackets ([]) and separate elements with commas.

**Example:**
```python
camping_list = ["Crystal Lake", 404, 89.3, True]
```

**Element Access:**

Use the index number to access individual elements.
- Positive index starts from 0 (first element).
- Negative index starts from -1 (last element).

**Example:**
```python
# Get the name of the campsite
campsite_name = camping_list[0]

# Get the dangerous status
is_dangerous = camping_list[-1]
```

**Additional Features:**

- **Different Data Types:** Lists can contain different data types (strings, integers, floats, booleans).
- **Negative Indexing:** Negative indices can be used to access elements from the end of the list.

**Benefits of Lists:**

- Store multiple pieces of data in a single variable.
- Organize data in a structured way.
- Easily reference and manipulate individual elements.
