**Key Concepts and Main Points:**

- **Private AI:** Running AI models on your own computer, locally, without using cloud-based services.
- **AI Model:** An artificial intelligence pre-trained on a specific dataset to perform certain tasks.
- **LLM:** Large Language Model, a type of AI model designed to understand and generate human-like text.
- **Hugging Face:** A platform providing access to a vast collection of AI models, including LLMs.
- **Lama:** A specific LLM developed by Meta.
- **Fine Tuning:** Training an AI model on a specific dataset to improve its performance on a particular task.
- **RAG:** Retrieval, Augment, Generate, a database technology used to connect AI models to external knowledge bases.

**Actionable Advice:**

- **Run Your Own Private AI:** Download and install Alamar and follow the instructions provided in the video to run your own LLM on your local computer.
- **Fine Tune Your AI Model:** Use VMware Private AI with Nvidia to fine-tune your AI model on your own data, without needing the extensive resources typically required.
