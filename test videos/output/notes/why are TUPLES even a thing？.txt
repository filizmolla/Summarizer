**Why Tuples Exist**

**Key Points:**

* Tuples are immutable (unchangeable) data structures, while lists are mutable.
* Tuples are faster than lists because they are stored in one block of memory.
* Tuples are useful for storing data that is not likely to change or for grouping different types of data.

**Demonstration:**

Using the timeit module, the video demonstrates that creating a million tuples takes 0.13 seconds, while creating a million lists takes 1.43 seconds.

**Use Cases for Tuples:**

* Storing data that is not likely to change (e.g., names of countries).
* Grouping different types of data (e.g., a tuple containing a YouTuber's name, subscriber count, and video types).
* SQL libraries in Python often return tuples when using fetch methods.
* Read-once data or function returns for faster loading speed.

**Interesting Features of Tuples:**

* Tuples can be unpacked into multiple variables in a single line of code.
* Tuples can be created without using parentheses (by separating elements with commas).
* Tuples can contain lists and other tuples, creating complex data structures.

**Specific Techniques:**

* **Immutable vs. Mutable:** Lists can be changed, while tuples cannot.
* **Storage:** Tuples are stored in one block of memory, while lists are stored in two blocks of memory.
* **Unpacking a Tuple:** Use the assignment operator to assign tuple elements to multiple variables at once.
* **Creating Tuples Without Parentheses:** Simply separate tuple elements with commas.
