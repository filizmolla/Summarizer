**Nested If Statements and Elif**

**Introduction**

* Control the flow of Python programming based on conditions.
* Introduce new concepts of nesting and elseif (elif) statements.

**Handling Evil Customers**

* Ask customers if they are evil (Ben).
* If evil (Ben), kick them out.
* Otherwise, welcome them.

**Nesting If Statements**

* Nested if statements allow for multiple conditions to be checked in order.
* The outer if statement checks if the customer's name is Ben.
* The inner if statement checks if the evil status is "yes".

**Elif (Else if) Statements**

* Elif statements allow for multiple conditions to be checked sequentially.
* If the first condition is false, the elif statement checks the next condition.
* In this example, the elif statement checks if the customer's name is Ben but not evil.

**Conditional Statements Summary**

* If: Checks if a condition is true.
* Else: Executes code if the if condition is false.
* Elif (else if): Checks if another condition is true if the if condition is false.

**Nested Elif Statements**

* Multiple elif statements can be nested within each other.
* This allows for complex conditions to be checked in a sequential order.

**Menu Pricing**

* Different items on the menu have different prices.
* Use elif statements to set the price based on the ordered item.

**Challenge Lab**

* Create a program that adds extra whipped cream to lattes and increases the price accordingly.

**Tips and Resources**

* Use different colors to highlight if, else, and elif statements in code.
