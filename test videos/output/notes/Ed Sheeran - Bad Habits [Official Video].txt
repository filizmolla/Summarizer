**Ed Sheeran - Bad Habits [Official Video]**

**Lyrics**

- "Every time the sun goes down I let you take control"
- "I can feel the paradise before my world implodes"
- "My bad habits lead to late nights and in a low"
- "Confessions with a stranger I barely know"
- "Swearing this will be the last but it probably won't"
- "Nothing happens after two"
- "Started on a new light, and then it all got dark"
- "You only know how to go too far"
- "I was looking for a way out now I can't escape"
- "We took a long way round but till the fun run out"
- "I hate I stare in space and I know I lose control of the things I say"
