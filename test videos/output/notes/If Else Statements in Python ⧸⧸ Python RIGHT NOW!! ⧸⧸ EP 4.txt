## If-Else Statements in Python

**Key Concepts:**

* **If statements:** Conditional statements that execute code only if a certain condition is true.
* **Else statements:** Alternative code to execute if the condition in the if statement is false.
* **Comparison operators:** Mathematical symbols that compare values, such as greater than (>) or equal to (==).
* **Indentation:** Python uses indentation to group code blocks, indicating which code belongs to which statement.

**Steps to Use If-Else Statements:**

1. Start with the `if` statement and a condition to evaluate.
2. Indent the code to be executed if the condition is true.
3. Add an `else` statement and indent the code to be executed if the condition is false.

**Examples and Techniques:**

* **Preventing "Evil Ben" from entering a coffee shop:**
    * Use an if statement to check if the person's name is "Ben".
    * If true, print a message unwelcome Ben.
    * If false, print a welcome message.
* **Using Comparison Operators:**
    * Greater than (`>`): `if 4 > 3:`
    * Less than (`<`): `if 2 < 3:`
    * Equal to (`==`): `if me == "network Chuck":`
* **Preventing Errors:**
    * Ensure proper indentation.
    * Use comparison operators correctly.
    * Define variables before using them in comparison operators.
