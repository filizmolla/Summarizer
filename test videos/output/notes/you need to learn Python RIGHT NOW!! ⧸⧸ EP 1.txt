## Learn Python Fundamentals

### Reasons to Learn Python

- High demand in IT and network engineering
- Powers ethical hacking and cloud engineering
- Accessible to beginners

### Getting Started with Python

- No software installation required
- Use a free Python lab in your browser

### Printing to the Terminal

- Print function: `print()`
- Enclose text in quotation marks for strings

### Strings in Python
