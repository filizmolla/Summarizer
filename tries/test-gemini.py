Often we try to convince other people or even ourselves. And how do we do this? Normally, we just present the cold, hard facts. The evidence, what we think, is clearly proof that what we say is right. But according to Socrates, there might be a different approach that is actually a lot more convincing. Not only for your discussion with other people, but also for getting to know yourself a little bit better and maybe finally making the switch from a bad habit to a good one. Because you begin to finally understand what it really means that you have this bad habit and what the consequences are when you continue this bad habit. What we're talking about today is the Socratic Method, which is basically saying through questioning we can get a lot deeper than through just giving the plain facts. You can convince someone by guiding him through the right questions rather than by just telling him what is right. Because if this person, if this individual really thinks about it, really thinks about these questions and then makes his own conclusions, then he at the very end might actually come to the same conclusion because he went to similar questions. But before we dive into the third part of this series on Socrates and the Socratic Method, what's going on powerful people? My name is Benjamin and I welcome you to today's video. If you're new to the channel, as always, click the subscribe button. If you haven't done so already, a huge shout out to Ely Z, David Rose, Gary Minnard, Aaron C, and Kiran Broadly for supporting me on Patreon. I truly appreciate your support, but without further ado, let's actually get right into it. The core idea of the Socratic Method is that the facts itself are not really that important. Also, what other people think is not really that important. The important aspect is what you think about the facts that are presented to you or what you think in general. And if we can get you to really think hardly about these facts, why you believe them or why you may not believe them, then we can also help you to really get a new conclusion or maybe a different perspective on things. The first essential step for this is breaking one problem, one fact, one idea, one belief system, whatever it may be, down into smaller subpieces, into smaller subparts, into smaller questions. Firstly, it's really about clarifying things because often when we have a conversation, when I'm talking to you, then there will be some discrepancy. Because I say something and you will understand something slightly different. Simply due to the fact that I've been brought up in a different culture, maybe in a different country, a different society, different parents, all of this stuff that just brought me to this day where I make slightly different conclusions than you do. And you do again, slightly different conclusions than I do. And this goes for all of us humans. So the first thing is that we really get some watch on a common ground where we really argue from the same perspective. So clearing things up so there's no misunderstanding in the first place is essential. Because if we build all subsequent questions upon this foundation, then the foundation should be rock solid. If we have a foundation where I have one understanding of a topic and you have a different understanding of a topic, and then we somehow try to find some common space through asking questions, then this is simply not going to work. Firstly, clarify what the other person or what yourself think about the topic at hand, the problem at hand. The Socratic method is often used to challenge deeply ingrained beliefs. We want to really challenge these beliefs that seem incredibly obvious, where just something... it's a no-brainer for you. You don't even think about it. These are the things that we want to question. Also, the things where you simply have to idea, hey, yeah, that's an easy one I can answer that simply. In some cases, that might actually be true. But more often than not, there is a lot deeper knowledge, a lot deeper meaning behind the thing where you really think that it's a simple matter. Most of the things that we humans experience are not as simple as you think at first. I really want you to understand how valuable this stuff can be for self-improvement in person or development. And also, one thing to always keep in mind, the Socratic method is never used to show superiority. For example, you could use the Socratic method, talk to someone, and by asking all these subsequent questions, you showed them how little they actually know, you showed them that their perspective, their viewpoint, their arguments, their conclusion is wrong. And you could say to yourself, hey, I'm superior because I showed you these flaws. No. The Socratic method is only used and should only be used for the simple purpose of educating and spreading awareness. It's by no means a tool for being superior or anything along those lines. It's just for educating, showing up flaws, and making people aware. This is not something that you should use to set yourself above the rest of the people that you associate with. While the Socratic method has to be adjusted to a very individual situation. And normally, it happens in a dialogue. And I'm talking to an audience right now. So that makes it a little bit more complicated. Yet, I still want to show you a simple example of how the Socratic method could work on a self-improvement topic. For example, a dogmatic belief that you have or just a belief system that you have in general. This is where your individual aspect of this video comes into play. Just take the belief system or the belief that came to mind when I first brought this up. Because that's probably a good thing to start. That's something that you strongly associate or disassociate with. In turn, it might be interesting to uncover whether your first impression of it was actually the right one, not the right one, or whether you should think about it further. Also, keep in mind, in the following example, I'll be going through six different types of questions. And I'm going through them in a very orderly fashion. Keep in mind that in a normal dialogue or when you do this yourself, that there is not always this simple progression of one question to another. After you start here, then you move maybe to step three. You go back to step one. This questioning process is something that can be very intricate, difficult, and complex. Keep that in mind when you pursue Socratic questioning so that you don't fall into the simplified scheme that I'm presenting right here. The first thing, as we already said, is clearing things up. So why do you have disbelief that you've just come up with that you are thinking about? Why do you have it? And also think about how disbelief that you're thinking about right now is related to other different beliefs that you have. Because let's face it, you don't just have one belief. This one belief is interlinked with all the other beliefs that you have in one way or another. You might not see an instant connection, but if you think about it for a little bit, then you might actually recognize that I don't know. A religious belief that you've just come up with is actually heavily influencing your work ethic or wise worser. Very frequently, there's simply a connection from one belief to another. So try to think about this. And don't hesitate to click the pause button because we're going through these questions rather quickly. This is just a basic example, but if you really want to do the exercise, then click the pause button after each question and really try to think about it a little bit and maybe you learn something new. The second type of questions that we have are the questions that probe an assumption on your case, the probe and belief. For example, you could ask, hey, are there similar beliefs out there? I have disbelief on this exact topic, but are there different perspectives on this topic? And how can we prove on this proof them? Is there evidence for one perspective? Might there actually be evidence for different perspectives as well? And usually by doing so, you begin to realize that your perspective might make sense to you, but you bring it into also realize that a different perspective could make sense to a different person because they simply take a look at other evidence. If you, for example, think about a religious belief, then you could have your religious belief and say it's based on the proof that there's the Bible or something along those lines. But what makes you say that the Bible is the right book then? If you, for example, take a look at a different religion, then they probably have a different book and they use this book as proof. Yet another religion has again a different book and they use that as proof. So really think about what is your belief and can you prove it and can you disprove others and does it make sense in a logical way? Ideally, you actually have a partner to do this with, a friend, a colleague, your relationship partner, just someone on the internet that can really probe your assumptions because doing it on your own, it's a little bit tricky because often we just fall back to our core beliefs and we try to find confirmation for the beliefs that we already have. And this is a lot easier than finding stuff that disproves our beliefs. So if you can find a partner for this ideally or not only you would be in a dialogue anyways. If you've only one hand looked for different assumptions and secondly also looked for evidence for these assumptions or evidence that disproves these assumptions then we need to again become a little bit more personal because right now you need to ask yourself why are you having this belief? Why is it so necessary to you? What does this belief give you? What is the value that it has for you individually? This is not a thing where you say all right religious beliefs, create a sense of community or something like that? No, this is where you really need to pinpoint what exact benefit does this belief have for you? This can be quite tricky because frequently we're just not focused on ourselves. We just blow up all the answers that seem to be doing right for most people but this is not a general thing. This is about you specifically about your individual situation. So really think deeply about what can this belief do for me? What is its benefit? What can I take from it? Why do I have it? Why do I think it is necessary to keep it? And by doing so you could also realize that it's actually not necessary. That's all right too. The thing with the Socratic method is always to dive one step deeper to maybe uncover something new. Maybe you at first thought it was necessary but after going through different assumptions, seeing different viewpoints or seeing evidence for different positions you might have changed your mind already a little bit and you could come to a different conclusion right now. Therefore the necessity of the belief is not a given anymore. In the next step we have questions to probe implications and consequences. So what are the consequences of you having this belief? And what would be the consequences of you shedding this belief? Really think about it for example, firstly on a very short term level. What would it mean if you dropped this belief or kept this belief for just the next day? What are its implications if you keep it for a week? A month, a year, 10 years, your entire life? What are the implications? What are the consequences of you keeping this belief? Is it good for you? Is it bad for you? Has it further implications for your entire life? Is it affecting the people around you? Again, this is still about your specific perspective on the thing but you also need to think now about what does it mean for the greater whole, for the greater body for the community that you live in? Would you lose your friends if you kept this belief? Would you lose your friends if you dropped the belief? What are the implications and what are the consequences of your exact belief? Is it keeping you cached? Is it keeping you for example, in a religion? Is it keeping you in a cult? Is it keeping you in a very dogmatic mindset? Is the belief that you currently have limiting or is it empowering? What does the belief do for you? What are its long term consequences? Lastly, we actually take a step back and question the original question. What was this good for? Why did we make this process? This is more of a meta analysis where we again look at the entire thing that we've just did where we've asked multiple questions and now we ask ourselves what was it for? Did it really change anything? Why did we ask the question in the first place? Did we come to a new conclusion? Is this process affecting us in our daily lives? No. Did we actually make a change or is everything just the same? It's really go in depth and ask what is going on around you? Really question these very core fundamental beliefs that you have because only if you question your core beliefs, your core values only then can you change them? And changing your core beliefs might be the essential step that you are lacking right now to live a more fulfilling and happy life because our core beliefs are at the end of the day the thing that keeps us going, that keeps us motivated or that keeps us depressed and sad. That being said, another huge shout out to Ilizzi, David Rose, Gary Minna, Aaron C and Kiran Brodley for supporting me on Patreon. I truly appreciate that. I have a subscribe button up there. Two more videos that you should watch next. I thank you for watching this short little series on Socrates. I hope you enjoyed it. I wish you a wonderful day and I will be seeing you in the very next video.
