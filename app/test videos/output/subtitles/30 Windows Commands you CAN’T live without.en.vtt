00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.350
You thought you were done, but no.

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.410
There are 35 more Windows commands
you need to know. Let's get right to,

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.680
the first thing we'll do is launch our
command prompt and B mode. Mr. B mode.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.090
So either hit Windows key S on your
keyboard or click the Windows icons as far

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.680
from there. Type in cmd, right click
and run as administrator. But hold up.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.860
What if it just ran as administrator
by default all the time?

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.550
Instead of clicking run as administrator,
click on open file location.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.550
There we have our command prompt
shortcut. Go ahead and right click back.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.260
Click on properties advanced and click
on Run as administrator by default.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.640
Sucker click okay, apply. Okay, so now
every time you run command prompts,

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.830
it will default to beast mode every time.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.340
This command will help you hide all your
deep dark secrets, the weird photos,

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.780
the journal, everything.
First,

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.930
I'll take all my images and my
journal and send them to a zip folder.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.200
And then with the copy command I can
hide the zip file inside a photo of a

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.390
kitten. Copy slash b,

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.020
specify the image plus
the name of your folder,

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.560
and then the name of your new secret
photo done to the random person.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.610
It's just a photo to you. It's a safe
with all your stuff. With this command,

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.850
we can encrypt every file in that
folder so that no one can even open it.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.420
If they do find it. Cipher
slash e and the folder,

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.310
I'm in every file encrypted.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.420
So now only I can open these files and
no one else can. This command is crazy.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.260
We can hide our folders from everyone
like this folder here with all my secrets.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.700
Keep an eye on it, it's gonna disappear.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.200
I'll type in a trip plus H plus S plus R,

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.070
and the name of our folder, boom,
it's gone. Even we can't see it.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.160
To bring it back, just do the opposite.
Change your pluses to minuses,

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.520
removing those attributes and the
invisibility cloak and there it is.

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.560
Net sh w n Show profile.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.620
This command will show you every wifi
network you've ever connected to.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.430
And what's even crazier is you can see
the wifi passwords for every network

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.000
right here in your terminal. Same
command net SH WLAN Show profile.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.000
Specify the wireless network.
I'll say see butterfly

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.490
and then type in key equals clear to
see the wifi password in plain text.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.470
There it is right here.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.830
If you wanna see all wifi passwords for
everything you have stored this crazy

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.090
command, this one-liner will send you
all of them. Now that's too much info,

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.190
too much to parse through in a
command prompt, what do you say?

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.710
We put it into a file. Let's
do that same command once more,

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.680
but at the very end we'll
do side arrow, side arrow,

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.870
I think it's what they're called.
And then the name of our file,

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.970
wifi passwords dot txt and bam.
All right there in a file. Austin.

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.850
Blur these please. Now you're never
gonna remember that command ever.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.150
So let's say we put it into a batch
file for safekeeping open notepad.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.110
I'll paste in this command and
these will all be below by the way,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.400
file save as all files and
we'll call it wifi dot bat.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.360
Now we just type in wifi
dot bat and there they are.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.030
This is a quick way to find out
all the info on your system.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.980
You simply type in system info

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.480
like this and it shows
you your system info. S,

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.040
P or secure copy lets you copy a file to
a remote server securely type in s sep

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.310
the file you want to copy and then the
username and the server you want copy to

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.530
mine will be route at the IP address,

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.140
then colon and where you want to
store it on that server. Hit enter,

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.050
authenticate with your password
and bam, that file is copied.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.330
I use this all the time now I
bet you didn't know this one.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.930
Check this out right from Explorer,
wherever I am, well say and Call of Duty.

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.730
I can go up to the address bar, type
in CMD, and suddenly a terminal,

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.910
a command prompt and Call of Duty
just like that. That's awesome.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.790
I can also do it in reverse where I'm
at right now in the command prompt.

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.200
I'll type in explorer

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.570
and then dot right after that
explorer window open right where I am.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:29.620
That's awesome.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.200
Did you know you can map any folder
on your system as a mounted tribes?

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:33.850
For real, check this out.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.380
The command will be S U B S T subs and
then a drive letter. Let's say S for,

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.630
do you want some more coffee?

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.580
Don't put a colon after that.
And then the location,

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:43.930
let's just use the one we have right here.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.820
I'll put that inside quotations and
I think it did it. Let's go check.

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.470
Let's open up explorer and yeah, there
it is. Drive S. If I click on that,

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.310
it goes right to the call of duty folder
like I mapped it. That's so weird.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.660
It'll probably want to undo that.

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.680
So the command is subs slash
d and then the drive letter,

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.100
which was oh S for some more coffee. Okay,

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.400
time for a quick coffee break and this
coffee break and the entire video is

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.150
sponsored by IT pro tv, which
is now it pro from ACI learning.

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.430
Now you're gonna need them because
of what I'm showing you here is just

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:16.840
scratching the surface on it.

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:19.150
If you wanna get a job and
change your stink and life,

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:22.540
they've got all the training you need to
start learning and growing. So I don't

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.670
care if you're just getting started
or you're a seasoned veteran,

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:26.230
there are always things
you have to learn cuz hey,

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.450
we're in it and things
are constantly changing.

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.240
So whether it's that first cert or
you finally wanna learn hacking,

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.340
they've got your back. And
I'm scared to say this,

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.280
but you probably don't even need
coffee. No, what am I saying?

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.270
Of course you need coffee,

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.240
but if you don't drink coffee you
may not need it because they're so

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.280
entertaining they won't put
you to sleep. Like seriously,

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.250
if you hang out with my friends
like Daniel Lowry and Ronnie Wong,

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.850
you're gonna have a good time.
So ccna a plus cloud stuff,

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.760
ethical hacking that got everything
and when you're done watching,

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:53.380
you can actually just start doing.

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.150
They've got labs baked in and practice
exams that'll help prepare you for exams.

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.690
Let's probably self-explanatory,
so if you wanna learn it like me,

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.910
check out it pro TV like below.
And if you use my code network, Chuck,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.560
you get 30% off forever.
So just just do it.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.730
It's cool. Coffee break over now it's
time to make your command prompt.

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.180
Pretty first command is color. Type in
color and just pick some random numbers.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.140
Like two and four. What? No, I can't,
I can't see anything. Zero one.

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.960
Well that's kind of nice. Four,
two. Okay. Okay, so &lt;laugh&gt;,

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.670
let me uh get some help here.
Color slash question mark. Ah,

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.600
so here's the colors. Let's
get it back. Seven, zero, nope.

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.200
Opposite zero seven. Actually I
wanna change it for the entire video.

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:41.980
Let's go green on black old
school. So two will be green.

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.880
That's the text black
zero the background. Nope,

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.720
I had it wrong. There we go. I spent
way too long in this command &lt;laugh&gt;.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.480
The first number is the background,

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.930
second number is the text. Now we can do
more to make this thing pretty like we

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:59.000
can change this. Check it out,
type in prompt bracket. Hey,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.790
beautiful closing bracket and
then dollar sign, capital G.

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.920
Now that's how you have
a prompt right there.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.290
Now you didn't need the brackets but
I thought it was prettier since we're

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.050
talking about pretty, you could do it
just like this, but that's not as pretty.

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.860
Now if this is not your thing, just simply
type in prompts and it will reset it.

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:15.770
Now if you wanna be even more
extra, cuz you do and I do too,

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.840
you can change the title
of your window as well.

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.610
For some reason it's all for prettiness.

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:23.780
So just type in title and then what
you wanna title it home. Sweet Home,

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.980
look at that. It changed the name.
That's nice. How much can you curl?

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:31.640
This next section is crazy. You ready
for this? Modern windows like Windows 11,

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.210
I think 10 has curl built
in. Curl is amazing.

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.540
So with the curl command we can do
things like, hey, what's the weather?

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:43.760
We can check the weather in our command.
Prompt curl w ttr, dash i n slash,

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.660
where are you? I'm in Dallas. The weather
right there in your command prompt.

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:50.180
This is the coolest way to
check the weather. Hands down,

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.240
this one's pretty cool. You can
actually unor shorten links,

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.770
see where it goes before you open it,

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:57.560
type in curl and a few parameters
like head and location.

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:01.220
And then these shorten your url, just
paste it in there and we'll get some info.

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.190
And then, because we only care about
the location of it, where it's going,

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:08.150
we'll do a bracket, type in fine
string and type in location. Bam,

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:11.300
shorten link goes here. And also you
should go there and check it out.

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:12.950
It pro tv. Shameless plug.

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:15.620
You can also check these status
of a website to see if it's up.

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:20.210
Type in curl dash capital I then
lowercase s and the website networks

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:24.470
chuck.com. Is it up right now? Sure.
Hope so. Yeah, it is 200. Okay,

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.930
which also happens to be the name of
the coffee I'm drinking right now.

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:29.520
Wow. Oh my goodness. Where do I buy.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.570
Some Curl Continues. What's
your public IP address?

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:36.800
Find out right from the
command line Curl check IP

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:42.110
amazon aws.com. Bam. Public
ip, but you can't see mine.

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:44.750
I've blurred it out, right? Austin,
you blurred that, right? Thank you.

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.850
This one's kind of dumb
but it's still pretty cool.

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:51.050
You can use Curl from your command prompt
to create a QR code type in Curl and

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:55.760
then QR, e n c o.de, and then slash the
website. You wanna make a QR code for?

00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:00.920
Let's do network chuck.coffee
and &lt;laugh&gt; QR code

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.890
right here in your command prompt.
That's just the coolest way to do it.

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:07.790
Let's see if it works. Dude, it totally
worked. That's awesome. You're welcome.

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:08.810
Now I have good news.

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:11.780
You no longer have to rely on YouTube
to know when I upload a video.

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.660
You can use the command prompt.
It does everything fact curl,

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:17.720
you can curl dash s and then this address,

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:21.020
which is kind of long and at the end just
say user equals whoever you wanna see,

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:24.170
and it will show you the latest
video from your favorite YouTuber,

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:27.230
at least the name of it. &lt;laugh&gt;, not
the entire video. That'd be kind of cool.

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:31.880
And you can even do it for Twitter.
Check this out. Same story, curl dash s,

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:34.370
but a Twitter U url. And
there's my latest tweet.

00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:37.700
You never ever have to leave the command
line. That's the point of this video.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:42.230
Stay here. I told you it's home.
Sweet home buddy. No curls not done.

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:45.680
A few more you can define a word
dictionary right in command,

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:50.180
prompt curl dick.org/d for

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:55.120
definition colon, and then a word. Let's
do the word of the day. Contra tense.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:00.420
An unexpected and untoward accident.
Something inopportune or embarrassing,

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:05.130
A hitch &lt;laugh&gt;. Use it in a word
in this unhappy contra tenses.

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:06.240
I'm never gonna use that word.

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:10.080
Now this is probably the coolest use
of Curl and it's where worlds collide.

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:10.800
Twin Worlds.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:15.060
Collide. Now did you know you can
use chat G p t from the command line?

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.120
This is crazy. Check this out.
Now we're also still using Curl.

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:20.220
I'm gonna paste in as long
command. I'll have it below.

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:24.000
Now let's ask it a question.
Who has the longest beard?

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:27.510
And there it is right there in
the command prompt. Eight feet,

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:31.260
two and a half inches. How do you
live? Dude must know so much about it.

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:34.140
Now we can use chat, G p, T
and Windows command prompt.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:38.220
It's only fair that chat G P T can
then use command prompt on it, right?

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:41.460
You can do that. By the way, found this
post on Reddit with a pretty fun prompt.

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:42.383
Let's try it out.

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:50.490
Okay, we gotta set up. Let's see if
it works. Yeah, I think so. Okay,

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:54.630
well you can't curl or do anything else.
Bust it is stupid. Here's a fun one.

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:56.280
You can open a website
right from your terminal.

00:09:56.310 --> 00:10:00.810
Just type in start the website and
it opens. With these two commands,

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:03.960
you can delete all the temporary files
to save some space if you're running

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:07.020
outta space. So you can download that new
Call of Duty update, run that command,

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:11.130
and then run this command space restored.
This one's pretty dumb and pretty fun.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.680
You may not have this command. Type in
Telenet and just see if you have it.

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:16.620
Hit enter. Oh, you don't have it.
Let's make sure you have it real quick.

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:20.430
Hit Windows key S and just search for
features and click on that first option

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:22.500
here. Turn Windows features on or off.

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:26.760
We're going to enable Telenet a very old
protocol that's probably not safer to

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:30.720
use for most things. Find Telenet,
click on it to enable it, click okay.

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:34.500
It's gonna install it real quick. Done
super fast. Now if you type in Telenet,

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:38.370
it should work. How do I get out of
here? Oh, type in Q. Okay, type in Q,

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:40.560
take me a minute, figure it
out. Now time for the fun stuff.

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:45.210
Type in Telenet and then
tele hack.com. Ready? Go.

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:48.990
Now pick your po, like maybe you wanna
watch Star Wars and your terminal.

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:51.000
Why not type in Star Wars?

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:52.980
And we're just gonna watch
this for the rest of the video.

00:10:56.210 --> 00:11:00.000
Ah, I'm got to this. Okay, that's
enough. Let's get out of there.

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:05.120
I had control C to stop it. Let's
try one more like Aquarium. Aquarium.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:09.150
I hear it. I mean that's just
nice to have. Now time for the Fs.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.780
F1 through nine can actually make
you pretty awesome on your command.

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:17.160
Prompt F1 will type in each
letter from the last command.

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:20.460
It's kinda strange. That's cool though.
Let me try it again with a real command.

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:24.750
Yeah, like I don't know what the use
case is for that. F two is even weirder.

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:26.910
So like for example,
if I type in IP config,

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:29.190
that's the previous
command I type in F two,

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:33.420
it's gonna prompt me to copy the previous
command up to a certain character.

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:37.800
If I type in like I, it's just gonna
copy some of it. It's, I don't know,

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:41.760
it's why common Blue If you
have a use case for that,

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:45.810
I don't know. F three is more useful.
It'll copy the entire previous line.

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:49.320
Okay, get that. F four
is weird too. &lt;laugh&gt;,

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:52.080
I'll type in IP and think again and I
have to go to the beginning of the line.

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:53.650
I'll type in F four and I'll say like,

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:57.550
where do you wanna delete the character
up to? Okay, let's delete it up to I.

00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:00.280
Okay, that's weird. I don't know. Again,

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:03.790
I'm sure people like are amazing
at this and find a great use case.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:06.880
I don't get it. F five is pretty cool.
You can cycle through previous commands.

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:10.090
Just F five at, yeah, I like it.

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:13.060
F six enters the EEO F or
the end of file indicator.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:15.730
That's handy for when you're hiding
stuff. F seven is pretty cool.

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:18.190
It opens up a list of previous commands.

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:20.110
Now this is probably the coolest one here.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:24.760
I wanna do that one. Like that's
awesome, right? Like, okay, that's, yep.

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:28.630
F eight will like enter the very first
command you typed in ever in this

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:31.480
terminal or this command prompt,
which apparently was cls.

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:35.440
And then F nine is pretty weird.
Um, it'll enter a previous command,

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:40.030
but it'll prompt you for the number.
So like, I don't know, 24. Okay,

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:44.350
that was the 24th command I entered in
this terminal. Again, weird use case.

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:46.690
Now to get a proper list of
all your commands printed out,

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:51.220
you can do this dokey dokey slash history.

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:53.650
Everything you ever did written
right here. It's pretty cool.

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:56.380
Now this next command is gonna break your
brain a little bit because what we're

00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:59.320
using right now, the command
prompt, it's old news, it's stupid.

00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:00.880
I shouldn't even showed you this.

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:04.360
The new kid on the block is
terminal built into Windows 11.

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:07.510
You can install on Windows 10. We're
gonna close command prompt and now search

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:10.180
for terminal. This thing's pretty slick.

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:12.910
You can do everything we just did
in Command Prompt, for example,

00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:15.640
we'll probably want an open command
prompt cause the default into Power Shop.

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:19.120
I'll cover that in a second. Click on the
little tab here and do Command Prompt.

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:22.510
But that's the killer feature,
right? Tabs. Oh my gosh. So cool.

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:25.480
Now because we're in terminal, it opens
up some new features we can talk about.

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:28.390
For example, maybe you're trying
to use secure copy to copy a file,

00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:30.610
but you're like, man, what's
that file name? I don't want to,

00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:32.230
I don't know where it is.
I don't wanna type it out.

00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:34.810
You can just open it and explore, find it,

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:37.450
and just drag it there and it copies it.

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.090
Could you imagine typing this
out or trying to find it?

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:43.510
That's awesome. Another cool thing is
that no matter where you are an explorer,

00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:48.040
you can shift, right? Click a
folder and say Open a terminal,

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:51.910
and bam, there you are. If you need help,
just simply ask for it. Type in help,

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:56.200
and it'll give you pretty much
every command you could ever want.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:57.460
I think that's a lot of 'em.

00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:02.620
And typing in any of these
commands like subst or start,

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:06.490
you can do a slash question
mark to see how to use it.

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:10.720
This command is not one at all.
It's this advice. Use this &lt;laugh&gt;.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:11.680
Use PowerShell.

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:15.370
PowerShell is better than Windows
Command for prompt in a lot of ways. Now,

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:18.010
don't get me wrong, I still use
Command Prompt for a lot of things.

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:20.590
It's just outta habit. It's
what I've used my entire career.

00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:24.010
But if you wanna learn anything, you
wanna dive deep. PowerShell is powerful.

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:26.230
It's like command prompt but
better. And you can do a lot more.

00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:28.660
And to use PowerShell, it's
already right here and terminal.

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:32.170
You can switch back and forth between
actually Azure Cloud Shell Command Prompt

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:34.660
and Windows Power Shell. That's
the video. See you later.
