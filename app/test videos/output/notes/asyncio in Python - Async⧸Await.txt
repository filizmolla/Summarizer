**Asyncio in Python**

**What is Async/Await?**

- Async/Await enables asynchronous programming in Python.
- Marking functions with `async` creates coroutines, which can be paused and resumed without blocking other tasks.

**Benefits of Async/Await**

- Concurrent execution of tasks, resulting in faster and more responsive programs.

**Example: Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Functions**

- Asynchronous functions execute tasks concurrently, completing tasks more quickly than synchronous functions.

**Another Example: Loading Data and Executing Tasks**

- Async/Await allows for loading heavy data and executing other tasks concurrently.
- The program exits once the data is loaded.

**Key Concepts**

- Asynchronous programming in Python involves using `async` functions and the `await` keyword.
- Coroutines can be paused and resumed, allowing other tasks to run.

**Actionable Advice**

- Use Async/Await to improve program speed and responsiveness.
