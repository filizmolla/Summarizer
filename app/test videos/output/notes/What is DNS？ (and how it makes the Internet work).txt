**What is DNS? (and how it makes the Internet work)**

**DNS - Domain Name System:**
- Translates human-readable website addresses into IP addresses (computer-readable).
- Operates like a phonebook for websites, mapping names to IP addresses.

**Process Overview:**

1. **Browser Query:** User types in a website address, e.g., academy.network chuck.com.
2. **Local DNS Resolver (Stub Resolver):** Checks local cache for IP address.
3. **Public DNS Server (e.g., Google's):** Queries DNS servers for IP address.

**DNS Hierarchy:**

- **Root Servers (12):** Managed by large organizations like NASA and DOD.
- **Top Level Domain Servers (TLD):** Responsible for top-level domains (.com, .net).
- **Authoritative DNS Servers:** Manage specific domains (e.g., academy.network chuck.com).

**DNS Security:**

- **DNS over HTTPS (DOH):** Encrypted DNS traffic, protecting user privacy.
- **Twin Gate:** VPN alternative that provides secure DNS.

**DNS Records:**

- **A Records:** Map domain names to IP addresses.
- **NS Records:** Specify authoritative DNS servers for domains.
- **MX Records:** Identify email servers for domains.
- **PTR Records:** Reverse DNS lookups, identifying domains associated with IP addresses.
- **CNAME Records:** Create domain name aliases.
- **TXT Records:** Used for various purposes, including SPF and DMARC records for email security.

**Domain Registration:**

- Acquired through a domain registrar (e.g., Squarespace).
- ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) governs DNS.
- Whois database stores registration information (name, address), which can be redacted for privacy.

**Running Your Own DNS Server:**

- Possible using a Raspberry Pi or similar device.
- Caches frequently visited websites and forwards unknown queries to upstream DNS servers.
- Can be customized to block ads.

**DNS Hacking (Foreshadowing):**

- Part 2 of this video will demonstrate how DNS can be hacked and how to perform ethical hacking to protect against these threats.
